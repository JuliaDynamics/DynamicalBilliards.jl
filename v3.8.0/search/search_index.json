With 3 simple steps, the user can get the output of the propagation of a particle in a billiard.\n\n\nIn general, the workflow of \nDynamicalBilliards\n follows these simple steps:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a billiard.\n\n\nCreate particles inside that billiard.\n\n\nGet the output you want by using one of the high level functions.\n\n\n\n\nAdding more complexity in your billiard does not add complexity in your code. For example, to implement a ray-splitting billiard you only need to define one additional variable, a \nRaySplitter\n and pass it to the high level functions.\n\n\nAfter reading through this page, you will be able to use almost all aspects of \nDynamicalBilliards\n with minimal effort.\n\n\n\n\nVisualizations\n\n\nVisualizing the billiards, particles and their motion is one of the most important parts of the \nDynamicalBilliards\n. It is not discussed in this page however, but rather in the \nVisualizing\n page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBilliard\n\n\nA \nBilliard\n is simply a collection of \nObstacle\n subtypes. Particles are propagating inside a \nBilliard\n, bouncing from obstacle to obstacle while having constant velocity in-between.\n\n\nThere is a \ntutorial\n on how to create your own billiard. In addition, there are many pre-defined billiards that can be found in the \nStandard Billiards Library\n section. That is why knowing how to construct a \nBilliard\n is not important at this point.\n\n\nIn this page we will be using the Bunimovich billiard as an example:\n\n\nusing\n \nDynamicalBilliards\n\n\nbd\n \n=\n \nbilliard_bunimovich\n()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBilliard\n{\nFloat64\n}\n \nwith\n \n4\n \nobstacles\n:\n\n  \nBottom\n \nwall\n\n  \nRight\n \nsemicircle\n\n  \nTop\n \nwall\n\n  \nLeft\n \nsemicircle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticles\n\n\nA \"particle\" is that thingy that moves around in the billiard. It always moves with velocity of measure 1, by convention.\n\n\nCurrently there are two types of particles:\n\n\n\n\nParticle\n, which propagates as a straight line.\n\n\nMagneticParticle\n, which propagates as a circle instead of a line (similar to electrons in a perpendicular magnetic field).\n\n\n\n\nThere are two ways to create a particle. The first one is to provide the constructor with some initial conditions:\n\n\nx0\n \n=\n \nrand\n();\n \ny0\n \n=\n \nrand\n();\n\n\n\u03c60\n \n=\n \n2\n\u03c0\n*\nrand\n()\n\n\np\n \n=\n \nParticle\n(\nx0\n,\n \ny0\n,\n \n\u03c60\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle\n{\nFloat64\n}\n\n\nposition\n:\n \n[\n0\n.\n3668573762560077\n,\n \n0\n.\n9672235763548052\n]\n\n\nvelocity\n:\n \n[\n-\n0\n.\n6847295873302676\n,\n \n-\n0\n.\n7287972229876576\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a \nMagneticParticle\n simply provide the constructor with one more number, the angular velocity:\n\n\n\u03c9\n \n=\n \n0.5\n\n\nmp\n \n=\n \nMagneticParticle\n(\nx0\n,\n \ny0\n,\n \n\u03c60\n,\n \n\u03c9\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagneticParticle\n{\nFloat64\n}\n\n\nposition\n:\n \n[\n0\n.\n3668573762560077\n,\n \n0\n.\n9672235763548052\n]\n\n\nvelocity\n:\n \n[\n-\n0\n.\n6847295873302676\n,\n \n-\n0\n.\n7287972229876576\n]\n\n\nang\n.\n \nvelocity\n:\n \n0\n.\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy the \n{Float64}\n ?\n\n\nWhen creating a billiard or a particle, the object is printed with \n{Float64}\n at the end. This shows what type of numbers are used for \nall\n numerical operations. If you are curious you can learn more about it in the \nnumerical precision page\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticles must be inside the Billiard!\n\n\nKeep in mind that the particle must be initialized \ninside a billiard\n for any functionality to work properly and make sense. If you are not sure what we mean by that, then you should check out the \nInternals page\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom initial conditions\n\n\nIf you have a \nBilliard\n which is not a rectangle, creating many random initial conditions inside it can be a pain. Fortunately, the second way to create a particle is to use the following function:\n\n\n#\n\n\nDynamicalBilliards.randominside\n \n \nFunction\n.\n\n\nrandominside\n(\nbd\n::\nBilliard\n \n[,\n \n\u03c9\n])\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn a particle with random allowed initial conditions inside the given billiard. If supplied with a second argument the type of the returned particle is \nMagneticParticle\n, with angular velocity \n\u03c9\n.\n\n\nWARNING\n : \nrandominside\n works for any \nconvex\n billiard but it does not work for non-convex billiards. (this is because it uses \ndistance\n)\n\n\nsource\n\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\np\n \n=\n \nrandominside\n(\nbd\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle\n{\nFloat64\n}\n\n\nposition\n:\n \n[\n0\n.\n29104552624466207\n,\n \n0\n.\n3932656624488904\n]\n\n\nvelocity\n:\n \n[\n-\n0\n.\n9512976653346544\n,\n \n0\n.\n30827382621435095\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand\n\n\nmp\n \n=\n \nrandominside\n(\nbd\n,\n \n\u03c9\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagneticParticle\n{\nFloat64\n}\n\n\nposition\n:\n \n[\n0\n.\n695949548794371\n,\n \n0\n.\n3117340156765278\n]\n\n\nvelocity\n:\n \n[\n0\n.\n9766238819828442\n,\n \n-\n0\n.\n2149553282446368\n]\n\n\nang\n.\n \nvelocity\n:\n \n0\n.\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrandominside\n always creates particles with same number type as the billiard.\n\n\n\n\nevolve\n \n \ntimeseries\n\n\nNow that we have created a billiard and a particle inside, we want to evolve it! There is a simple function for that, called \nevolve!\n (or \nevolve\n if you don't want to mutate the particle), which returns the time, position and velocities at the collision points:\n\n\n#\n\n\nDynamicalBilliards.evolve!\n \n \nFunction\n.\n\n\nevolve!\n([\np\n::\nAbstractParticle\n,]\n \nbd\n::\nBilliard\n,\n \nt\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolve the given particle \np\n inside the billiard \nbd\n. If \nt\n is of type \nAbstractFloat\n, evolve for as much time as \nt\n. If however \nt\n is of type \nInt\n, evolve for as many collisions as \nt\n. Return the states of the particle between collisions.\n\n\nThis function mutates the particle, use \nevolve\n otherwise. If a particle is not given, a random one is picked through \nrandominside\n.\n\n\nReturn\n\n\n\n\nct::Vector{T}\n : Collision times.\n\n\nposs::Vector{SVector{2,T}}\n : Positions at the collisions.\n\n\nvels::Vector{SVector{2,T}})\n : Velocities exactly after the collisions.\n\n\n\u03c9\n, either \nT\n or \nVector{T}\n : Angular velocity/ies (returned only for magnetic particles).\n\n\n\n\nThe time \nct[i+1]\n is the time necessary to reach state \nposs[i+1], vels[i+1]\n starting from the state \nposs[i], vels[i]\n. That is why \nct[1]\n is always 0 since \nposs[1], vels[1]\n are the initial conditions.

In general, the workflow of  DynamicalBilliards  follows these simple steps:   Create a billiard.  Create particles inside that billiard.  Get the output you want by using one of the high level functions.   Adding more complexity in your billiard does not add complexity in your code. For example, to implement a ray-splitting billiard you only need to define one additional variable, a  RaySplitter  and pass it to the high level functions.  After reading through this page, you will be able to use almost all aspects of  DynamicalBilliards  with minimal effort.   Visualizations  Visualizing the billiards, particles and their motion is one of the most important parts of the  DynamicalBilliards .

Currently there are two types of particles:   Particle , which propagates as a straight line.  MagneticParticle , which propagates as a circle instead of a line (similar to electrons in a perpendicular magnetic field).   There are two ways to create a particle. The first one is to provide the constructor with some initial conditions:  x0   =   rand ();   y0   =   rand ();  \u03c60   =   2 \u03c0 * rand ()  p   =   Particle ( x0 ,   y0 ,   \u03c60 )   Particle { Float64 }  position :   [ 0 . 3668573762560077 ,   0 . 9672235763548052 ]  velocity :   [ - 0 . 6847295873302676 ,   - 0 . 7287972229876576 ]   To create a  MagneticParticle  simply provide the constructor with one more number, the angular velocity:  \u03c9   =   0.5  mp   =   MagneticParticle ( x0 ,   y0 ,   \u03c60 ,   \u03c9 )   MagneticParticle { Float64 }  position :   [ 0 . 3668573762560077 ,   0 . 9672235763548052 ]  velocity :   [ - 0 . 6847295873302676 ,   - 0 . 7287972229876576 ]  ang .   velocity :   0 . 5    Why the  {Float64}  ?  When creating a billiard or a particle, the object is printed with  {Float64}  at the end. This shows what type of numbers are used for  all  numerical operations. If you are curious you can learn more about it in the  numerical precision page .    Particles must be inside the Billiard!  Keep in mind that the particle must be initialized  inside a billiard  for any functionality to work properly and make sense. If you are not sure what we mean by that, then you should check out the  Internals page .",

In other applications however one prefers to have the time series of the individual variables. For this, the  timeseries  function is used:  #  DynamicalBilliards.timeseries!     Function .  timeseries! ([ p :: AbstractParticle ,]   bd :: Billiard ,   t ;   dt ,   warning )   Evolve the given particle  p  inside the billiard  bd .  If  t  is of type  AbstractFloat , evolve for as much time as  t . If however  t  is of type  Int , evolve for as many collisions as  t . Return:   x position time-series  y position time-series  x velocity time-series  y velocity time-series  time vector   This function mutates the particle, use  timeseries  otherwise. If a particle is not given, a random one is picked through  randominside .  The keyword argument  dt  is the time step used for interpolating the time series in between collisions.  dt  is capped by the collision time, as the interpolation  always  stops at collisions. For straight propagation  dt = Inf , while for magnetic  dt = 0.01 .  For pinned magnetic particles,  timeseries!  issues a warning and returns the trajectory of the particle. If  t  is integer, the trajectory is evolved for one full circle only.  Internally uses  DynamicalBilliards.extrapolate .  Ray-splitting billiards  timeseries ! ( p ,   bd ,   t ,   raysplitters ;   ...)   To implement ray-splitting, the  timeseries!  function is supplemented with a fourth argument,  raysplitters  which is a tuple of  RaySplitter  instances. Notice that  timeseries   always mutates the billiard  if ray-splitting is used!

For this we have the following function:  #  DynamicalBilliards.visited_obstacles!     Function .  visited_obstacles! ([ p :: AbstractParticle ,]   bd :: Billiard ,   t )   Evolve the given particle  p  inside the billiard  bd  exactly like  evolve! . However return only:   ts::Vector{T}  : Vector of time points of when each collision occured.  obst::Vector{Int}  : Vector of obstacle indices in  bd  that the particle collided with at the time points in  ts .   The first entries are  0.0  and  0 . Similarly with  evolve!  the function does not record collisions with periodic walls.  Currently does not support raysplitting. Returns empty arrays for pinned particles.  source   Type of  t  Remember that the behavior of time evolution depends on the type of the  t  argument, which represents \"total amount\". If it is  AbstractFloat , it represents total amount of time, but if it is  Int  it represents total number of collisions.",

Let's animate a particle inside a simple pentagon with magnetic field:\n\n\nbd\n \n=\n \nbilliard_polygon\n(\n5\n,\n \n1\n)\n\n\na\n \n=\n \nDisk\n([\n0.0\n,\n0.0\n],\n \n0.4\n)\n\n\nbd\n \n=\n \nBilliard\n(\nbd\n.\nobstacles\n...\n,\n \na\n)\n\n\np\n \n=\n \nMagneticParticle\n(\n0\n,\n \n-\n0.5\n,\n \n0\n,\n \n1.0\n)\n\n\n\nanimate_evolution\n(\np\n,\n \nbd\n,\n \n10.0\n;\n \nsavename\n \n=\n \npenta\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nThe cool thing about \nanimate_evolution\n is that it can animate multiple particles simultaneously! For example, here is a beautiful demonstration of chaos in non-dispersive billiards:\n\n\nbd\n \n=\n \nbilliard_stadium\n()\n\n\nN\n \n=\n \n20\n\n\ncs\n \n=\n \n[(\ni\n/\nN\n,\n \n0\n,\n \n1\n \n-\n \ni\n/\nN\n,\n \n0.5\n)\n \nfor\n \ni\n \nin\n \n1\n:\nN\n]\n\n\nps\n \n=\n \n[\nParticle\n(\n1\n,\n \n0.6\n \n+\n \n0.0005\n*\ni\n,\n \n0\n)\n \nfor\n \ni\n \nin\n \n1\n:\nN\n]\n\n\n\nanimate_evolution\n(\nps\n,\n \nbd\n,\n \n10.0\n;\n \ncolors\n \n=\n \ncs\n,\n \ntailtime\n \n=\n \n1.5\n,\n \nsavename\n \n=\n \ndisperse\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nPeriodic Billiards\n\n\nIn order to plot periodic billiards, you have need to call a different method of \nplot\n, since now you also have to specify the limits of plotting. The methods provided are:\n\n\nplot\n(\nbd\n,\n \nxmin\n,\n \nymin\n,\n \nxmax\n,\n \nymax\n)\n\n\nplot\n(\nbd\n,\n \nxt\n::\nVector\n{\nT\n},\n \nyt\n::\nVector\n{\nT\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last one conveniently plots the combo of particle-trajectory and periodic-billiard taking care of all the details internally. Give the keyword \nplot_orbit = false\n if you do not want to plot the orbit defined by \n(xt, yt)\n.\n\n\nFor example, the following code\n\n\nusing\n \nDynamicalBilliards\n,\n \nPyPlot\n\n\nr\n \n=\n \n0.25\n\n\nbd\n \n=\n \nbilliard_rectangle\n(\n2\n,\n \n1\n;\n \nsetting\n \n=\n \nperiodic\n)\n\n\nd\n \n=\n \nDisk\n([\n0.5\n,\n \n0.5\n],\n \nr\n)\n\n\nd2\n \n=\n \nEllipse\n([\n1.5\n,\n \n0.5\n],\n \nr\n,\n \n2\nr\n/\n3\n)\n\n\nbd\n \n=\n \nBilliard\n(\nbd\n.\nobstacles\n...\n,\n \nd\n,\n \nd2\n)\n\n\np\n \n=\n \nParticle\n(\n1.0\n,\n \n0.5\n,\n \n0.2\n)\n\n\nxt\n,\n \nyt\n,\n \nvxt\n,\n \nvyt\n,\n \nt\n \n=\n \ntimeseries!\n(\np\n,\n \nbd\n,\n \n10\n)\n\n\nplot\n(\nbd\n,\n \nxt\n,\n \nyt\n)\n\n\nplot\n(\np\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, you can also periodically plot billiards with hexagonal periodicity. Only give the keyword argument \nhexagonal = true\n to \nplot\n.

            "text": "Ray-Splitting\n\n\nRay-splitting is a semi-classical approach to the billiard system, giving a wave attribute to the ray traced by the particle. Upon collision a particle may propagate through an obstacle (transmission \n refraction) or be reflected. Following the mindset of this package, implementing a ray-splitting billiard requires only three simple steps. We will introduce them and demonstrate them using a simple example in this documentation page.\n\n\n\n\n1. Ray-Splitting Obstacles\n\n\nThe first step is that an \nObstacle\n that supports ray-splitting is required to be present in your billiard table. The only new feature these obstacles have is an additional Boolean field called \npflag\n (propagation flag). This field notes on which side of the obstacle the particle is currently propagating.\n\n\nThe normal vector as well as the distance from boundary change sign depending on the value of \npflag\n. The obstacles \nAntidot\n and \nSplitterWall\n are the equivalents of disk and wall for ray-splitting.\n\n\nLet's create a billiard with a bunch of ray-splitting obstacles!\n\n\nusing\n \nDynamicalBilliards\n\n\nx\n,\n \ny\n \n=\n \n2.0\n,\n \n1.0\n\n\nbdr\n \n=\n  \nbilliard_rectangle\n(\nx\n,\n \ny\n)\n\n\nsw\n \n=\n \nSplitterWall\n([\nx\n/\n2\n,\n \n0.0\n],\n \n[\nx\n/\n2\n,\ny\n],\n \n[\n-\n1\n,\n0\n],\n \ntrue\n)\n\n\na1\n \n=\n \nAntidot\n([\nx\n/\n4\n,\n \ny\n/\n2\n],\n \n0.25\n,\n \nLeft Antidot\n)\n\n\na2\n \n=\n \nAntidot\n([\n3\nx\n/\n4\n,\n \ny\n/\n2\n],\n \n0.15\n,\n \nRight Antidot\n)\n\n\nbd\n \n=\n \nBilliard\n(\na1\n,\n \na2\n,\n \nsw\n,\n \nbdr\n...\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBilliard\n{\nFloat64\n}\n \nwith\n \n7\n \nobstacles\n:\n\n  \nLeft\n \nAntidot\n\n  \nRight\n \nAntidot\n\n  \nSplitter\n \nwall\n\n  \nBottom\n \nwall\n\n  \nRight\n \nwall\n\n  \nTop\n \nwall\n\n  \nLeft\n \nwall\n\n\n\n\n\n\nusing\n \nPyPlot\n\n\nplot\n(\nbd\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The \nRaySplitter\n structure\n\n\nIn the second step, you have to define 2+1 functions: transmission probability, refraction angle and optionally new angular velocity after transmission. These functions, as well as which obstacles participate in ray-splitting, are bundled into a special structure:\n\n\n#\n\n\nDynamicalBilliards.RaySplitter\n \n \nType\n.\n\n\nRaySplitter\n(\nidxs\n,\n \ntransmission\n,\n \nrefraction\n \n[,\n \nnewangular\n];\n \naffect\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn a \nRaySplitter\n instance, used to perform raysplitting. \nidxs\n is a \nVector{Int}\n with the indices of the obstacles that this \nRaySplitter\n corresponds to.\n\n\ntransmission\n, \nrefraction\n and \nnewangular\n are \nfunctions\n. Let \n\u03c6\n be the angle of incidence and \n\u03c9\n be the angular velocity and \npflag\n the propagation flag (before transmission). The functions have the following signatures:\n\n\n\n\ntransmission(\u03c6, pflag, \u03c9) -\n T\n, transmission probability.\n\n\nrefraction(\u03c6, pflag, \u03c9) -\n \u03b8\n, refraction angle. This angle is \nrelative\n to the normal vector.\n\n\nnewangular(\u03c9, pflag) -\n new\u03c9\n, new angular velocity after transmission.\n\n\n\n\nThe above three functions use the \nsame convention\n: the argument \npflag\n is the one the obstacle has \nbefore transmission\n. For example, if a particle is outside an \nAntidot\n (with \npflag = true\n here) and is transmitted inside the \nAntidot\n (\npflag\n becomes \nfalse\n here), then all three functions will be given their second argument (the Boolean one) as \ntrue\n!\n\n\naffect\n is a function, and denotes which obstacles of the billiard are affected when transmission occurs at obstacle \ni\n (for which obstacles should the field \npflag\n be reversed). Defaults to \nidxs = (i) -\n i\n, i.e. only the colliding obstacle is affected. If you want many obstacles to be affected you could write \nidxs = (i) -\n SVector(2,3,5)\n, etc. Keep in mind that the only values of \ni\n that can be passed into this function are the ones that are given in the argument \nidxs\n!\n\n\nsource\n\n\n\n\nIf you want different type of transmission/refraction functions for different obstacles, then you define multiple \nRaySplitter\ns.\n\n\nContinuing from the above billiard, let's also create some \nRaySplitter\n instances for it.\n\n\nFirst define a refraction function\n\n\nrefraction\n(\n\u03c6\n,\n \npflag\n,\n \n\u03c9\n)\n \n=\n \npflag\n \n?\n \n0.5\n\u03c6\n \n:\n \n2.0\n\u03c6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrefraction\n \n(\ngeneric\n \nfunction\n \nwith\n \n1\n \nmethod\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, a transmission probability function. In this example, we want to create a function that given some factor \np\n, it returns a probability weighted with \np\n in one direction of ray-splitting and \n1-p\n in another direction.\n\n\ntransmission_p\n(\np\n)\n \n=\n \n(\n\u03c6\n,\n \npflag\n,\n \n\u03c9\n)\n \n-\n \nbegin\n\n    \nif\n \npflag\n\n        \np\n*\nexp\n(\n-\n(\n\u03c6\n)\n^\n2\n/\n2\n(\n\u03c0\n/\n8\n)\n^\n2\n)\n\n    \nelse\n\n        \nabs\n(\n\u03c6\n)\n \n \n\u03c0\n/\n4\n \n?\n \n(\n1\n-\np\n)\n*\nexp\n(\n-\n(\n\u03c6\n)\n^\n2\n/\n2\n(\n\u03c0\n/\n4\n)\n^\n2\n)\n \n:\n \n0.0\n\n    \nend\n\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntransmission_p\n \n(\ngeneric\n \nfunction\n \nwith\n \n1\n \nmethod\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice also how we defined the function in such a way that critical refraction is respected, i.e. if \n\u03b8(\u03c6) \u2265 \u03c0/2\n then \nT(\u03c6) = 0\n. Although this is necessary from a physical perspective, the code does take care of it by clamping the refraction angle (see below).\n\n\nLastly, for this example we will use magnetic propagation. We define functions such that the antidots also reverse the direction and magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\n\nnewoantidot\n(\nx\n,\n \nbool\n)\n \n=\n  \nbool\n \n?\n \n-\n2.0\nx\n \n:\n \n-\n0.5\nx\n\n\nnewowall\n(\nx\n,\n \nbool\n)\n \n=\n \nbool\n \n?\n \n0.5\nx\n \n:\n \n2.0\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnewowall\n \n(\ngeneric\n \nfunction\n \nwith\n \n1\n \nmethod\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we create the \nRaySplitter\n instances we want\n\n\nraywall\n \n=\n \nRaySplitter\n([\n3\n],\n \ntransmission_p\n(\n0.5\n),\n \nrefraction\n,\n \nnewowall\n)\n\n\nraya\n \n=\n \nRaySplitter\n([\n1\n,\n \n2\n],\n \ntransmission_p\n(\n0.8\n),\n \nrefraction\n,\n \nnewoantidot\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaySplitter\n \nfor\n \nindices\n [\n1\n, \n2\n]\n \ntransmission\n: \n#1\n\n \nrefraction\n:   \nrefraction\n\n \nnew\n \nangular\n:  \nnewoantidot\n\n \naffect\n:       \ndefault\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause we want to use same functions for both antidots, we gave both indices in \nraya\n, \n[1, 2]\n (which are the indices of the antidots in the billiard \nbd\n).\n\n\n\n\n3. Evolution with Ray-Splitting\n\n\nThe third step is trivial. After you have created your \nRaySplitter\n(s), you simply pass them into \nevolve\n or \nanimate_evolution\n as a fourth argument! If you have many instances of \nRaySplitter\n you pass a tuple of them.\n\n\nFor example,\n\n\np\n \n=\n \nrandominside\n(\nbd\n,\n \n1.0\n)\n\n\nraysplitters\n \n=\n \n(\nraywall\n,\n \nraya\n)\n\n\nxt\n,\n \nyt\n,\n \nvxt\n,\n \nvyt\n,\n \ntt\n \n=\n \ntimeseries\n(\np\n,\n \nbd\n,\n \n100\n,\n \nraysplitters\n)\n\n\nplot\n(\nbd\n)\n\n\nplot\n(\nxt\n,\n \nyt\n)\n\n\nscatter\n(\nxt\n[\n1\n],\n \nyt\n[\n1\n],\n \ncolor\n \n=\n \nblack\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u250c\n \nWarning\n:\n \n`\na\n:\n:\nStaticArray\n \n-\n \nb\n:\n:\nNumber\n`\n \nis\n \ndeprecated\n,\n \nuse\n \n`\na\n \n.\n-\n \nb\n`\n \ninstead\n.\n\n\n\u2502\n   \ncaller\n \n=\n \ncellsize\n \nat\n \nobstacles\n.\njl\n:\n546\n \n[\ninlined\n]\n\n\n\u2514\n \n@\n \nCore\n \n~/\nbuild\n/\nJuliaDynamics\n/\nDynamicalBilliards\n.\njl\n/\nsrc\n/\nbilliards\n/\nobstacles\n.\njl\n:\n546\n\n\n\u250c\n \nWarning\n:\n \n`\na\n:\n:\nStaticArray\n \n+\n \nb\n:\n:\nNumber\n`\n \nis\n \ndeprecated\n,\n \nuse\n \n`\na\n \n.\n+\n \nb\n`\n \ninstead\n.\n\n\n\u2502\n   \ncaller\n \n=\n \ncellsize\n \nat\n \nobstacles\n.\njl\n:\n547\n \n[\ninlined\n]\n\n\n\u2514\n \n@\n \nCore\n \n~/\nbuild\n/\nJuliaDynamics\n/\nDynamicalBilliards\n.\njl\n/\nsrc\n/\nbilliards\n/\nobstacles\n.\njl\n:\n547\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that at some points the particle crossed the boundaries of the red obstacles, which allow for ray splitting. It is even cooler to animate this motion using \nanimate_evolution\n!\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nResetting the billiard\n\n\nNotice that evolving a particle inside a billiard always mutates the billiard if ray-splitting is used. This means that you should always set the fields \npflag\n of some obstacles to the values you desire after \neach\n call to \nevolve\n. If you use the function \nrandominside\n you must definitely do this!\n\n\nThe function \nreset_billiard!(bd)\n turns all \npflag\ns to \ntrue\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAngle of refraction is clamped\n\n\nInternally we clamp the output of the angle of refraction function. Let \nc = DynamicalBilliards.CLAMPING_ANGLE\n (currently \nc = 0.1\n). We clamp \n\u03b8\n to \n-\u03c0/2 + c \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0/2 - c\n. This is so that the relocating algorithm does not fall into an infinite loop.\n\n\n\n\n    \nYou\n \ncan\n \nchange\n \nthe\n \nvalue\n \nof\n \n`c`\n \nbut\n \nvery\n \nsmall\n \nvalues\n \ncan\n \nlead\n \nto\n \ninfinite\n \nloops\n \nin\n \nextreme\n \ncases\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ray-Splitting Algorithm\n\n\nIn this section we describe the algorithm we follow to implement the ray-splitting process. Let \nT\nT\n denote the transmission function, \n\\theta\n\\theta\n the refraction function and \n\\omega_{\\text{new}}\n\\omega_{\\text{new}}\n the new angular velocity function. The following describes the process after a particle has reached an obstacle that supports ray-splitting.\n\n\n\n\nFind the angle of incidence \n\\phi' = \\pi - \\arccos(\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{n}) = \\arccos(\\vec{v} \\cdot (-\\vec{n}))\n\\phi' = \\pi - \\arccos(\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{n}) = \\arccos(\\vec{v} \\cdot (-\\vec{n}))\n with \n\\vec{n}\n\\vec{n}\n the normal vector at collision point. Notice that we use here \n-\\vec{n}\n-\\vec{n}\n because the velocity is opposing the normal vector before the collision happens. Using \n-\\vec{n}\n-\\vec{n}\n gives the angle between 0 and \n\\pi/2\n\\pi/2\n instead of \n\\pi/2\n\\pi/2\n to \n\\pi\n\\pi\n.\n\n\nFind the \ncorrect\n sign of the incidence angle, \n\\phi = \\pm \\phi'\n\\phi = \\pm \\phi'\n. Specifically, use the cross product: if the third entry of \n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{n}\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{n}\n is negative, then have minus sign. The \"correct\" sign debates on whether the velocity vector is to the right or to the left of \n(-\\vec{n})\n(-\\vec{n})\n. This is important for finding the correct transmission angle and/or probability.\n\n\nCheck if \nT(\\phi, \\verb|pflag|, \\omega) \n \\text{random}()\nT(\\phi, \\verb|pflag|, \\omega) > \\text{random}()\n. If not, do standard specular reflection.\n\n\nIf ray-splitting happens, then relocate the particle so that it is on the \nother\n side of the colliding obstacle. This contrasts the main evolution algorithm of this billiard package.\n\n\nRe-compute the \ncorrect\n angle of incidence, as the position of the particle generally changes with relocating.\n\n\nFind refraction angle \n\\theta(\\phi, \\verb|pflag|, \\omega)\n\\theta(\\phi, \\verb|pflag|, \\omega)\n. Notice that this is a relative angle with respect to the normal vector. Also notice that \n\\theta\n\\theta\n may have opposite sign from \n\\phi\n\\phi\n. It depends on the user if they want to add anomalous refraction.\n\n\nSet \nobstacle.pflag = !obstacle.pflag\n for \nall\n obstacles affected by the current \nRaySplitter\n. This reverses \n\\vec{n}\n\\vec{n}\n to \n-\\vec{n}\n-\\vec{n}\n as well! So from now on \n\\vec{n}\n\\vec{n}\n is the opposite than what it was at the beginning of the algorithm!\n\n\nFind the refraction angle in absolute space. First find \na = \\text{atan}(n_y, n_x)\na = \\text{atan}(n_y, n_x)\n and then set \n\\Theta = a + \\theta\n\\Theta = a + \\theta\n.\n\n\nPerform refraction, i.e. set the particle velocity to the direction of \n\\Theta\n\\Theta\n.\n\n\nScale the magnetic field, i.e. set \np.omega\n = \n\\omega_{\\text{new}}(\\omega, \\verb|!pflag|)\n\\omega_{\\text{new}}(\\omega, \\verb|!pflag|)\n.

            "text": "In the second step, you have to define 2+1 functions: transmission probability, refraction angle and optionally new angular velocity after transmission. These functions, as well as which obstacles participate in ray-splitting, are bundled into a special structure:  #  DynamicalBilliards.RaySplitter     Type .  RaySplitter ( idxs ,   transmission ,   refraction   [,   newangular ];   affect )   Return a  RaySplitter  instance, used to perform raysplitting.  idxs  is a  Vector{Int}  with the indices of the obstacles that this  RaySplitter  corresponds to.  transmission ,  refraction  and  newangular  are  functions . Let  \u03c6  be the angle of incidence and  \u03c9  be the angular velocity and  pflag  the propagation flag (before transmission). The functions have the following signatures:   transmission(\u03c6, pflag, \u03c9) -  T , transmission probability.  refraction(\u03c6, pflag, \u03c9) -  \u03b8 , refraction angle. This angle is  relative  to the normal vector.  newangular(\u03c9, pflag) -  new\u03c9 , new angular velocity after transmission.   The above three functions use the  same convention : the argument  pflag  is the one the obstacle has  before transmission . For example, if a particle is outside an  Antidot  (with  pflag = true  here) and is transmitted inside the  Antidot  ( pflag  becomes  false  here), then all three functions will be given their second argument (the Boolean one) as  true !  affect  is a function, and denotes which obstacles of the billiard are affected when transmission occurs at obstacle  i  (for which obstacles should the field  pflag  be reversed). Defaults to  idxs = (i) -  i , i.e. only the colliding obstacle is affected. If you want many obstacles to be affected you could write  idxs = (i) -  SVector(2,3,5) , etc. Keep in mind that the only values of  i  that can be passed into this function are the ones that are given in the argument  idxs !  source   If you want different type of transmission/refraction functions for different obstacles, then you define multiple  RaySplitter s.  Continuing from the above billiard, let's also create some  RaySplitter  instances for it.  First define a refraction function  refraction ( \u03c6 ,   pflag ,   \u03c9 )   =   pflag   ?   0.5 \u03c6   :   2.0 \u03c6   refraction   ( generic   function   with   1   method )   Then, a transmission probability function. In this example, we want to create a function that given some factor  p , it returns a probability weighted with  p  in one direction of ray-splitting and  1-p  in another direction.  transmission_p ( p )   =   ( \u03c6 ,   pflag ,   \u03c9 )   -   begin \n     if   pflag \n         p * exp ( - ( \u03c6 ) ^ 2 / 2 ( \u03c0 / 8 ) ^ 2 ) \n     else \n         abs ( \u03c6 )     \u03c0 / 4   ?   ( 1 - p ) * exp ( - ( \u03c6 ) ^ 2 / 2 ( \u03c0 / 4 ) ^ 2 )   :   0.0 \n     end  end   transmission_p   ( generic   function   with   1   method )   Notice also how we defined the function in such a way that critical refraction is respected, i.e. if  \u03b8(\u03c6) \u2265 \u03c0/2  then  T(\u03c6) = 0 . Although this is necessary from a physical perspective, the code does take care of it by clamping the refraction angle (see below).  Lastly, for this example we will use magnetic propagation. We define functions such that the antidots also reverse the direction and magnitude of the magnetic field.  newoantidot ( x ,   bool )   =    bool   ?   - 2.0 x   :   - 0.5 x  newowall ( x ,   bool )   =   bool   ?   0.5 x   :   2.0 x   newowall   ( generic   function   with   1   method )   Now we create the  RaySplitter  instances we want  raywall   =   RaySplitter ([ 3 ],   transmission_p ( 0.5 ),   refraction ,   newowall )  raya   =   RaySplitter ([ 1 ,   2 ],   transmission_p ( 0.8 ),   refraction ,   newoantidot )   RaySplitter   for   indices  [ 1 ,  2 ]\n  transmission :  #1 \n  refraction :    refraction \n  new   angular :   newoantidot \n  affect :        default   Because we want to use same functions for both antidots, we gave both indices in  raya ,  [1, 2]  (which are the indices of the antidots in the billiard  bd ).",

It is even cooler to animate this motion using  animate_evolution !        Resetting the billiard  Notice that evolving a particle inside a billiard always mutates the billiard if ray-splitting is used. This means that you should always set the fields  pflag  of some obstacles to the values you desire after  each  call to  evolve . If you use the function  randominside  you must definitely do this!  The function  reset_billiard!(bd)  turns all  pflag s to  true .    Angle of refraction is clamped  Internally we clamp the output of the angle of refraction function. Let  c = DynamicalBilliards.CLAMPING_ANGLE  (currently  c = 0.1 ). We clamp  \u03b8  to  -\u03c0/2 + c \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0/2 - c . This is so that the relocating algorithm does not fall into an infinite loop.        You   can   change   the   value   of   `c`   but   very   small   values   can   lead   to   infinite   loops   in   extreme   cases .",

Find the  correct  sign of the incidence angle,  \\phi = \\pm \\phi' \\phi = \\pm \\phi' .

Find refraction angle  \\theta(\\phi, \\verb|pflag|, \\omega) \\theta(\\phi, \\verb|pflag|, \\omega) . Notice that this is a relative angle with respect to the normal vector.

Since the \"code\" velocity has measure one, the rotation radius is given by   \nr = \\frac{1}{\\omega_\\text{code}} = \\frac{v_\\text{real}}{\\omega_\\text{real}}  \nr = \\frac{1}{\\omega_\\text{code}} = \\frac{v_\\text{real}}{\\omega_\\text{real}}   then one simply has to adjust the values of  \u03c9  given in the code with   \n\\omega_\\text{code} = \\frac{\\omega_\\text{real}}{v_\\text{real}}  \n\\omega_\\text{code} = \\frac{\\omega_\\text{real}}{v_\\text{real}}   After getting the timeseries:  # These are the  code -data. |v| = 1 always  ct ,   poss ,   vels ,   omegas   =   evolve ( p ,   bd ,   ttotal )  xt ,   yt ,   vxt ,   vyt ,   t   =   timeseries ( p ,   bd ,   ttotal )   you only need to make some final adjustment on the  vxt, vyt . The position and time data are completely unaffected.  omegas_code   =   omegas  # real angular velocities:  omegas_real   =   supplied_by_user  # or with some user provided function:  f   =   o   -   ( o   ==   0.5   ?   2 o   :   o *\u221a 2 )  omegas_real   =   f . ( omegas_code )  # real velocity measure:  vels_real   =   abs . ( omegas_real   ./   omegas_code )  contt   =   cumsum ( ct )  omega_t   =   zeros ( t )  vxtreal   =   copy ( vxt )  vytreal   =   copy ( vyt )  j   =   1  for   i   in   eachindex ( t ) \n   vxtreal [ i ]   *=   vels_real [ j ] \n   vytreal [ i ]   *=   vels_real [ j ] \n   omega_t [ i ]   =   omegas_real [ j ] \n\n   if   t [ i ]   =    contt [ j ] \n     j   +=   1 \n   end  end   Now you can be sure that the particle at time  t[i]  had real velocity  [vxtreal[i], vytreal[i]]  and was propagating with real angular velocity  omega_t[i] .",

Positive distance corresponds to the particle being on the \nallowed\n region of the \nObstacle\n. E.g. for a \nDisk\n, the distance is positive when the particle is outside of the disk, negative otherwise.\n\n\ndistance\n(\np\n::\nAbstractParticle\n,\n \nbd\n::\nBilliard\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn minimum \ndistance(p, obst)\n for all \nobst\n in \nbd\n. If the \ndistance(p, bd)\n is negative and \nbd\n is convex, this means that the particle is outside the billiard.\n\n\nWARNING\n : \ndistance(p, bd)\n may give negative values for non-convex billiards, or billiards that are composed of several connected sub-billiards.\n\n\nAll \ndistance\n functions can also be given a position (vector) instead of a particle.\n\n\nsource\n\n\nNotice that for very small negative values of distance, \ncollision\n takes care of finite precision issues and does not return wrong collisions.\n\n\n\n\nNumerical Precision\n\n\nAll core types of \nDynamicalBilliards\n are parametrically constructed, with parameter \nT \n: AbstractFloat\n. This means that the fields of all particles and obstacles contain numbers strictly of type \nT\n. You will understand why this choice happened as you continue reading this paragraph.\n\n\nThe main concerns during evolution in a billiard table are:\n\n\n\n\nThe particle must never leak out of the billiard table. This is simply translated to the \ndistance\n function being positive after any collision \nand\n that \ncollision\n takes care of extreme cases with very small (but negative) distance.\n\n\nThe collision time is never infinite, besides the cases of \npinned particles\n in a magnetic billiard.\n\n\n\n\nThese are solved with two ways:\n\n\n\n\nAfter the next collision is computed, \nrelocate!\n brings the particle to that point and calculates the \ndistance\n with the colliding obstacle. If it is negative, it translates the particle's position by this distance, \nalong the normal vector\n.\n\n\ncollision\n takes care of cases where the distance between particle and obstacle is less than \naccuracy(::T)\n. (This is necessary only for magnetic propagation, as for straight propagation checking the velocity direction with respect to the normal is always enough).\n\n\n\n\nAdjusting the global precision of \nDynamicalBilliards\n is easy and can be done by choosing the floating precision you would like.

For functions like  boundarymap , it is expected (if possible) that the obstacles of the billiard are sorted, such that the arc-coordinate  \u03be  around the billiard is increasing counter-clockwise.  \u03be  is measured as:   the distance from start point to end point in  Wall s  the arc length measured counterclockwise from the open face in  Semicircle s  the arc length measured counterclockwise from the rightmost point in  Circular s   source   A  Billiard  is a wrapper of a  Tuple  of  Obstacle s. The abstract Type  Obstacle{T}  is the supertype of all objects that a particle may collide with, with global billiard precision of type  T .  There are many premade functions that construct well-known billiards, like the periodic Sinai billiard. You can find all of them at the  Standard Billiards Library .  To create a custom billiard from scratch, it is often convenient to start with an empty  Vector{Obstacle{T}} :  using   DynamicalBilliards  bd   =   Obstacle { Float64 }[]    # T : AbstractFloat   0 - element   Array { Obstacle { Float64 } , 1 }   and then you create your obstacles one by one and add them to it. All obstacles that are already defined in the package can be found at the  Obstacles library  below.  For the example of this page, we will create a hexagonal billiard with a disk in the middle step-by-step (the function  billiard_polygon  creates a polygonal billiard table already).  The first step is to define the six walls of the billiard table. An  InfiniteWall  object needs to be supplemented with a start point, an end point, a normal vector and, optionally, a name.  The vertex points of a regular hexagon of radius  r r  are given by the formula:   \n(x,y) = \\left( r\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{6}\\right), r\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{6}\\right) \\right)\\,, \\quad \\text{for i $\\in$ \\{1,...,6\\}}  \n(x,y) = \\left( r\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{6}\\right), r\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{6}\\right) \\right)\\,, \\quad \\text{for i $\\in$ \\{1,...,6\\}}   To create each wall object, we will implement the following loop:  hexagon_vertex   =   ( r )   -   [   [ r * cos ( 2 \u03c0 * i / 6 ),   r * sin ( 2 \u03c0 * i / 6 )]   for   i   in   1 : 6 ]  hexver   =   hexagon_vertex ( 2.0 )  for   i   in   eachindex ( hexver ) \n   starting   =   hexver [ i ] \n   ending   =   hexver [ mod1 ( i + 1 ,   length ( hexver ))] \n   w   =   ending   -   starting \n   normal   =   [ - w [ 2 ],   w [ 1 ]] \n   wall   =   InfiniteWall ( starting ,   ending ,   normal ,   wall  $i ) \n   push! ( bd ,   wall )  end  summary ( bd )   6-element Array{Obstacle{Float64},1}    Keep the size around 1.  Because the precision in  DynamicalBilliards  is measured using  eps(T)  with  T  the number type, it is advised to keep the size of the billiard in the order of magnitude of 1. Having overly large billiards with sizes of 100 or more can lead to accuracy loss!   The  normal  vector of a  Wall  obstacle is necessary to be supplemented by the user because it must point towards where the particle is expected to come from. If  w  is the vector (wall) pointing from start- to end-point then the vector  [-w[2], w[1]]  is pointing to the left of  w  and the vector  [w[2], -[w1]]  is pointing to the right. Both are normal to  w , but you have to know which one to pick. In this case this is very easy, since the normal has to simply point towards the origin.   There is no glue.  In  DynamicalBilliards  there is no \"glue\" that combines obstacles or \"sticks\" them together, ensuring that the billiard is closed. You only have to take care that their ends meet geometrically. Even obstacle overlapping is allowed, if you want to be on the safe side!   We add a disk by specifying a center and radius (and optionally a name):  d   =   Disk ([ 0 , 0 ],   0.8 )  push!

Create a particle inside that billiard and evolve it:  using   PyPlot  plot ( billiard )  \u03c9   =   0.5  p   =   randominside ( billiard ,   \u03c9 )  xt ,   yt ,   vxt ,   vyt ,   t   =   timeseries!

            "text": "Creating your own \nObstacle\n Type\n\n\nIn this tutorial we will go through the processes of creating a new obstacle type, a \nSemicircle\n. This type is already used in the \nbilliard_bunimovich\n and \nbilliard_mushroom\n functions.\n\n\n\n\nEverything uses \nSVector{2}\n\n\nFields of \nParticle\ns and \nObstacle\ns contain all their information in 2-dimensional static vectors from module \nStaticArrays\n. This is important to keep in mind when extending new methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtends internal APIs\n\n\nNotice that implementing your own obstacle requires you to extend methods that \ndo not\n belong to the public API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also the \nEllipse\n PR\n\n\nPull Request \n#159\n implements the \nEllipse\n obstacle, step by step, by following the tutorial of this page. All commits are commented and it can be a second helpful guide on how to implement an obstacle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType Definition\n\n\nThe first thing you have to do is make your new type a sub-type of \nObstacle{T}\n (or any other abstract sub-type of it). We will do:\n\n\nstruct\n \nSemicircle\n{\nT\n:\nAbstractFloat\n}\n \n:\n \nCircular\n{\nT\n}\n \n# \n: Obstacle{T}\n\n    \nc\n::\nSVector\n{\n2\n,\nT\n}\n \n# this MUST be a static vector\n\n    \nr\n::\nT\n\n    \nfacedir\n::\nSVector\n{\n2\n,\nT\n}\n \n# this MUST be a static vector\n\n    \nname\n::\nString\n \n# this is an OPTIONAL field\n\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc\n is the center and \nr\n is the radius of the full circle. \nfacedir\n is the direction which the semicircle is facing, which is also the direction of its \"open\" face.\n\n\nname\n is an optional field, that allows one to easily identify which obstacle is which. It is also used when printing a \nBilliard\n. If not used, then \nstring(typeof(obstacle))\n is used instead.\n\n\nNotice that the \nstruct\n \nmust be\n parameterized by \nT\n:AbstractFloat\n (see the \nnumerical precision\n page for more).\n\n\nFor convenience, we will also define:\n\n\nfunction\n \nSemicircle\n(\n\n    \nc\n::\nAbstractVector\n{\nT\n},\n \nr\n::\nReal\n,\n \nfacedir\n,\n \nname\n \n=\n \nSemicircle\n)\n \nwhere\n \n{\nT\n:\nReal\n}\n\n    \nS\n \n=\n \nT\n \n:\n \nInteger\n \n?\n \nFloat64\n \n:\n \nT\n\n    \nreturn\n \nSemicircle\n{\nS\n}(\nSVector\n{\n2\n,\nS\n}(\nc\n),\n \nconvert\n(\nS\n,\n \nabs\n(\nr\n)),\n \nname\n)\n\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nso that constructing a \nSemicircle\n is possible from arbitrary vectors.\n\n\n\n\nNecessary Methods\n\n\nThe following functions must obtain methods for \nSemicircle\n (or any other custom \nObstacle\n) in order for it to work with \nDynamicalBilliards\n:\n\n\n\n\nDynamicalBilliards.normalvec\n\n\nDynamicalBilliards.distance\n (with arguments \n(position, obstacle)\n)\n\n\nDynamicalBilliards.collision\n with \nParticle\n\n\n\n\nAssuming that upon collision a specular reflection happens, then you don't need to define a method for \nDynamicalBilliards.specular!\n. You can however define custom methods for \nDynamicalBilliards.specular!\n, which is what we have done e.g. for \nRandomDisk\n.\n\n\n\n\nUse \nimport\n!\n\n\nNotice that you have to properly \nimport\n the methods to extend them. For example, do \nimport DynamicalBilliards: normalvec, distance, collision\n time.\n\n\n\n\nThe first method is very simple, just do:\n\n\nimport\n \nDynamicalBilliards\n:\n \nnormalvec\n,\n \ndistance\n,\n \ncollision\n\n\nnormalvec\n(\nd\n::\nSemicircle\n,\n \npos\n)\n \n=\n \nnormalize\n(\nd\n.\nc\n \n-\n \npos\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the function is only used during \ndistance\n and \nDynamicalBilliards.resolvecollision!\n and since we will be writing explicit methods for the first, we don't have to care about what happens when the particle is far away from the boundary.\n\n\nThe \ndistance\n method is a bit tricky. Since the type already subtypes \nCircular\n, the following definition from \nDynamicalBilliards\n applies:\n\n\ndistance\n(\npos\n::\nAbstractVector\n,\n \nd\n::\nCircular\n)\n \n=\n \nnorm\n(\npos\n \n-\n \nd\n.\nc\n)\n \n-\n \nd\n.\nr\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the method must be expanded. That is because when the particle is on the \"open\" half of the disk, the distance is not correct. We write:\n\n\nSV\n \n=\n \nSVector\n{\n2\n}\n \n#convenience\n\n\nfunction\n \ndistance\n(\npos\n::\nAbstractVector\n{\nT\n},\n \ns\n::\nSemicircle\n{\nT\n})\n \nwhere\n \n{\nT\n}\n\n    \n# Check on which half of circle is the particle\n\n    \nv1\n \n=\n \npos\n \n.-\n \ns\n.\nc\n\n    \nnn\n \n=\n \ndot\n(\nv1\n,\n \ns\n.\nfacedir\n)\n\n    \nif\n \nnn\n \n\u2264\n \n0\n \n# I am \ninside semicircle\n\n        \nreturn\n \ns\n.\nr\n \n-\n \nnorm\n(\npos\n \n-\n \ns\n.\nc\n)\n\n    \nelse\n \n# I am on the \nother side\n\n        \nend1\n \n=\n \nSV\n(\ns\n.\nc\n[\n1\n]\n \n+\n \ns\n.\nr\n*\ns\n.\nfacedir\n[\n2\n],\n \ns\n.\nc\n[\n2\n]\n \n-\n \ns\n.\nr\n*\ns\n.\nfacedir\n[\n1\n])\n\n        \nend2\n \n=\n \nSV\n(\ns\n.\nc\n[\n1\n]\n \n-\n \ns\n.\nr\n*\ns\n.\nfacedir\n[\n2\n],\n \ns\n.\nc\n[\n2\n]\n \n+\n \ns\n.\nr\n*\ns\n.\nfacedir\n[\n1\n])\n\n        \nreturn\n \nmin\n(\nnorm\n(\npos\n \n-\n \nend1\n),\n \nnorm\n(\npos\n \n-\n \nend2\n))\n\n    \nend\n\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that this definition always returns positive distance when the particle is on the \"other side\".\n\n\nFinally, the method for \ncollision\n is by far the most \ntrickiest\n. But, with pen, paper and a significant amount of patience, one can find a way:\n\n\nfunction\n \ncollision\n(\np\n::\nParticle\n{\nT\n},\n \nd\n::\nSemicircle\n{\nT\n})\n::\nT\n \nwhere\n \n{\nT\n}\n\n\n    \ndc\n \n=\n \np\n.\npos\n \n-\n \nd\n.\nc\n\n    \nB\n \n=\n \ndot\n(\np\n.\nvel\n,\n \ndc\n)\n         \n#velocity towards circle center: B \n 0\n\n    \nC\n \n=\n \ndot\n(\ndc\n,\n \ndc\n)\n \n-\n \nd\n.\nr\n*\nd\n.\nr\n    \n#being outside of circle: C \n 0\n\n    \n\u0394\n \n=\n \nB\n^\n2\n \n-\n \nC\n\n\n    \n\u0394\n \n\u2264\n \n0\n \n \nreturn\n \nnocollision\n(\nT\n)\n\n    \nsqrtD\n \n=\n \nsqrt\n(\n\u0394\n)\n\n\n    \nnn\n \n=\n \ndot\n(\ndc\n,\n \nd\n.\nfacedir\n)\n\n    \nif\n \nnn\n \n\u2265\n \n0\n \n# I am NOT inside semicircle\n\n        \n# Return most positive time\n\n        \nt\n \n=\n \n-\nB\n \n+\n \nsqrtD\n\n    \nelse\n \n# I am inside semicircle:\n\n        \nt\n \n=\n \n-\nB\n \n-\n \nsqrtD\n\n        \n# these lines make sure that the code works for ANY starting position:\n\n        \nif\n \nt\n \n\u2264\n \n0\n \n||\n \ndistance\n(\np\n,\n \nd\n)\n \n\u2264\n \naccuracy\n(\nT\n)\n\n            \nt\n \n=\n \n-\nB\n \n+\n \nsqrtD\n\n        \nend\n\n    \nend\n\n    \n# This check is necessary to not collide with the non-existing side\n\n    \nnewpos\n \n=\n \np\n.\npos\n \n+\n \np\n.\nvel\n \n*\n \nt\n\n    \nif\n \ndot\n(\nnewpos\n \n-\n \nd\n.\nc\n,\n \nd\n.\nfacedir\n)\n \n\u2265\n \n0\n \n# collision point on BAD HALF;\n\n        \nreturn\n \nnocollision\n(\nT\n)\n\n    \nend\n\n    \n# If collision time is negative, return Inf:\n\n    \nt\n \n\u2264\n \n0.0\n \n?\n \nnocollision\n(\nT\n)\n \n:\n \n(\nt\n,\n \np\n.\npos\n \n+\n \nt\n*\np\n.\nvel\n)\n\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that is all. The obstacle now works perfectly fine for straight propagation.\n\n\n\n\nRay-Splitting support\n\n\nSupporting ray-splitting for your custom obstacle is very easy. The first step is to give it a field called \npflag\n, which is a \nBool\n. The second step is to ensure that \ncollisiontime\n works properly for particles coming from both directions of the obstacle! Both inside or outside!

It is also used when printing a  Billiard . If not used, then  string(typeof(obstacle))  is used instead.  Notice that the  struct   must be  parameterized by  T :AbstractFloat  (see the  numerical precision  page for more).

            "text": "The following functions must obtain methods for  Semicircle  (or any other custom  Obstacle ) in order for it to work with  DynamicalBilliards :   DynamicalBilliards.normalvec  DynamicalBilliards.distance  (with arguments  (position, obstacle) )  DynamicalBilliards.collision  with  Particle   Assuming that upon collision a specular reflection happens, then you don't need to define a method for  DynamicalBilliards.specular! . You can however define custom methods for  DynamicalBilliards.specular! , which is what we have done e.g. for  RandomDisk .   Use  import !  Notice that you have to properly  import  the methods to extend them. For example, do  import DynamicalBilliards: normalvec, distance, collision  time.   The first method is very simple, just do:  import   DynamicalBilliards :   normalvec ,   distance ,   collision  normalvec ( d :: Semicircle ,   pos )   =   normalize ( d . c   -   pos )   Since the function is only used during  distance  and  DynamicalBilliards.resolvecollision!  and since we will be writing explicit methods for the first, we don't have to care about what happens when the particle is far away from the boundary.  The  distance  method is a bit tricky. Since the type already subtypes  Circular , the following definition from  DynamicalBilliards  applies:  distance ( pos :: AbstractVector ,   d :: Circular )   =   norm ( pos   -   d . c )   -   d . r   However, the method must be expanded. That is because when the particle is on the \"open\" half of the disk, the distance is not correct. We write:  SV   =   SVector { 2 }   #convenience  function   distance ( pos :: AbstractVector { T },   s :: Semicircle { T })   where   { T } \n     # Check on which half of circle is the particle \n     v1   =   pos   .-   s . c \n     nn   =   dot ( v1 ,   s . facedir ) \n     if   nn   \u2264   0   # I am  inside semicircle \n         return   s . r   -   norm ( pos   -   s . c ) \n     else   # I am on the  other side \n         end1   =   SV ( s . c [ 1 ]   +   s . r * s . facedir [ 2 ],   s . c [ 2 ]   -   s . r * s . facedir [ 1 ]) \n         end2   =   SV ( s . c [ 1 ]   -   s . r * s . facedir [ 2 ],   s . c [ 2 ]   +   s . r * s . facedir [ 1 ]) \n         return   min ( norm ( pos   -   end1 ),   norm ( pos   -   end2 )) \n     end  end   Notice that this definition always returns positive distance when the particle is on the \"other side\".  Finally, the method for  collision  is by far the most  trickiest . But, with pen, paper and a significant amount of patience, one can find a way:  function   collision ( p :: Particle { T },   d :: Semicircle { T }) :: T   where   { T } \n\n     dc   =   p . pos   -   d . c \n     B   =   dot ( p . vel ,   dc )           #velocity towards circle center: B   0 \n     C   =   dot ( dc ,   dc )   -   d . r * d . r      #being outside of circle: C   0 \n     \u0394   =   B ^ 2   -   C \n\n     \u0394   \u2264   0     return   nocollision ( T ) \n     sqrtD   =   sqrt ( \u0394 ) \n\n     nn   =   dot ( dc ,   d . facedir ) \n     if   nn   \u2265   0   # I am NOT inside semicircle \n         # Return most positive time \n         t   =   - B   +   sqrtD \n     else   # I am inside semicircle: \n         t   =   - B   -   sqrtD \n         # these lines make sure that the code works for ANY starting position: \n         if   t   \u2264   0   ||   distance ( p ,   d )   \u2264   accuracy ( T ) \n             t   =   - B   +   sqrtD \n         end \n     end \n     # This check is necessary to not collide with the non-existing side \n     newpos   =   p . pos   +   p . vel   *   t \n     if   dot ( newpos   -   d . c ,   d . facedir )   \u2265   0   # collision point on BAD HALF; \n         return   nocollision ( T ) \n     end \n     # If collision time is negative, return Inf: \n     t   \u2264   0.0   ?   nocollision ( T )   :   ( t ,   p . pos   +   t * p . vel )  end   And that is all. The obstacle now works perfectly fine for straight propagation.   Ray-Splitting support  Supporting ray-splitting for your custom obstacle is very easy. The first step is to give it a field called  pflag , which is a  Bool . The second step is to ensure that  collisiontime  works properly for particles coming from both directions of the obstacle! Both inside or outside! This is implemented for  Ellipse  in Pull Request  #159 .",
