            "text": "High Level API\n\n\nDynamicalBilliards\n was created with ease-of-use as its main cornerstone. With 3 simple steps, the user can get the output of the propagation of a particle in a billiard.\n\n\nIn general, the workflow of \nDynamicalBilliards\n follows these simple steps:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a billiard.\n\n\nCreate particles inside that billiard.\n\n\nGet the output you want by using one of the high level functions.\n\n\n\n\nAdding more complexity in your billiard does not add complexity in your code. For example, to implement a ray-splitting billiard you only need to define one additional variable, a \nRaySplitter\n and pass it to the high level functions.\n\n\nAfter reading through this page, you will be able to use almost all aspects of \nDynamicalBilliards\n with minimal effort.\n\n\n\n\nVisualizations\n\n\nVisualizing the billiards, particles and their motion is one of the most important parts of the \nDynamicalBilliards\n. It is not discussed in this page however, but rather in the \nVisualizing\n page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBilliard\n\n\nA \nBilliard\n is simply a collection of \nObstacle\n subtypes. Particles are propagating inside a \nBilliard\n, bouncing from obstacle to obstacle while having constant velocity in-between.\n\n\nThere is a \ntutorial\n on how to create your own billiard. In addition, there are many pre-defined billiards that can be found in the \nStandard Billiards Library\n section. That is why knowing how to construct a \nBilliard\n is not important at this point.\n\n\nIn this page we will be using the Bunimovich billiard as an example:\n\n\nusing\n \nDynamicalBilliards\n\n\nbd\n \n=\n \nbilliard_bunimovich\n()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBilliard{Float64} with 4 obstacles:\n  Bottom wall\n  Right semicircle\n  Top wall\n  Left semicircle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticles\n\n\nA \"particle\" is that thingy that moves around in the billiard. It always moves with velocity of measure 1, by convention.\n\n\nCurrently there are two types of particles:\n\n\n\n\nParticle\n, which propagates as a straight line.\n\n\nMagneticParticle\n, which propagates as a circle instead of a line (similar to electrons in a perpendicular magnetic field).\n\n\n\n\nThere are two ways to create a particle. The first one is to provide the constructor with some initial conditions:\n\n\nx0\n \n=\n \nrand\n();\n \ny0\n \n=\n \nrand\n();\n\n\n\u03c60\n \n=\n \n2\n\u03c0\n*\nrand\n()\n\n\np\n \n=\n \nParticle\n(\nx0\n,\n \ny0\n,\n \n\u03c60\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle{Float64}\nposition: [0.690007, 0.201921]\nvelocity: [-0.302733, 0.953075]\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a \nMagneticParticle\n simply provide the constructor with one more number, the angular velocity:\n\n\n\u03c9\n \n=\n \n0.5\n\n\nmp\n \n=\n \nMagneticParticle\n(\nx0\n,\n \ny0\n,\n \n\u03c60\n,\n \n\u03c9\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagneticParticle{Float64}\nposition: [0.690007, 0.201921]\nvelocity: [-0.302733, 0.953075]\nang. velocity: 0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy the \n{Float64}\n ?\n\n\nWhen creating a billiard or a particle, the object is printed with \n{Float64}\n at the end. This shows what type of numbers are used for \nall\n numerical operations. If you are curious you can learn more about it in the \nnumerical precision page\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticles must be inside the Billiard!\n\n\nKeep in mind that the particle must be initialized \ninside a billiard\n for any functionality to work properly and make sense. If you are not sure what we mean by that, then you should check out the \nInternals page\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom initial conditions\n\n\nIf you have a \nBilliard\n which is not a rectangle, creating many random initial conditions inside it can be a pain. Fortunately, the second way to create a particle is to use the following function:\n\n\n#\n\n\nDynamicalBilliards.randominside\n \n \nFunction\n.\n\n\nrandominside(bd::Billiard [, \u03c9])\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn a particle with random allowed initial conditions inside the given billiard. If supplied with a second argument the type of the returned particle is \nMagneticParticle\n, with angular velocity \n\u03c9\n.\n\n\nsource\n\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\np\n \n=\n \nrandominside\n(\nbd\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle{Float64}\nposition: [0.646374, 0.020144]\nvelocity: [-0.118434, 0.992962]\n\n\n\n\n\nand\n\n\nmp\n \n=\n \nrandominside\n(\nbd\n,\n \n\u03c9\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagneticParticle{Float64}\nposition: [0.408039, 0.789647]\nvelocity: [0.869305, -0.494275]\nang. velocity: 0.5\n\n\n\n\n\nrandominside\n always creates particles with same number type as the billiard.\n\n\n\n\nevolve\n \n \ntimeseries\n\n\nNow that we have created a billiard and a particle inside, we want to evolve it! There is a simple function for that, called \nevolve!\n (or \nevolve\n if you don't want to mutate the particle), which returns the time, position and velocities at the collision points:\n\n\n#\n\n\nDynamicalBilliards.evolve!\n \n \nFunction\n.\n\n\nevolve!([p::AbstractParticle,] bd::Billiard, t)\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolve the given particle \np\n inside the billiard \nbd\n. If \nt\n is of type \nAbstractFloat\n, evolve for as much time as \nt\n. If however \nt\n is of type \nInt\n, evolve for as many collisions as \nt\n. Return the states of the particle between collisions.\n\n\nThis function mutates the particle, use \nevolve\n otherwise. If a particle is not given, a random one is picked through \nrandominside\n.\n\n\nReturn\n\n\n\n\nct::Vector{T}\n : Collision times.\n\n\nposs::Vector{SVector{2,T}}\n : Positions at the collisions.\n\n\nvels::Vector{SVector{2,T}})\n : Velocities exactly after the collisions.\n\n\n\u03c9\n, either \nT\n or \nVector{T}\n : Angular velocity/ies (returned only for magnetic particles).\n\n\n\n\nThe time \nct[i+1]\n is the time necessary to reach state \nposs[i+1], vels[i+1]\n starting from the state \nposs[i], vels[i]\n. That is why \nct[1]\n is always 0 since \nposs[1], vels[1]\n are the initial conditions. The angular velocity \n\u03c9[i]\n is the one the particle has while propagating from state \nposs[i], vels[i]\n to \ni+1\n.\n\n\nNotice that at any point, the velocity vector \nvels[i]\n is the one obdained \nafter\n the specular reflection of the \ni-1\nth collision.\n\n\nRay-splitting billiards\n\n\nevolve!(p, bd, t, raysplitters)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo implement ray-splitting, the \nevolve!\n function is supplemented with a fourth argument, \nraysplitters\n which is a tuple of \nRaySplitter\n instances. Notice that \nevolve\n \nalways mutates the billiard\n if ray-splitting is used!

For example, to implement a ray-splitting billiard you only need to define one additional variable, a  RaySplitter  and pass it to the high level functions.  After reading through this page, you will be able to use almost all aspects of  DynamicalBilliards  with minimal effort.   Visualizations  Visualizing the billiards, particles and their motion is one of the most important parts of the  DynamicalBilliards . It is not discussed in this page however, but rather in the  Visualizing  page.",

Particles are propagating inside a  Billiard , bouncing from obstacle to obstacle while having constant velocity in-between.  There is a  tutorial  on how to create your own billiard. In addition, there are many pre-defined billiards that can be found in the  Standard Billiards Library  section. That is why knowing how to construct a  Billiard  is not important at this point.  In this page we will be using the Bunimovich billiard as an example:  using   DynamicalBilliards  bd   =   billiard_bunimovich ()   Billiard{Float64} with 4 obstacles:\n  Bottom wall\n  Right semicircle\n  Top wall\n  Left semicircle",

Currently there are two types of particles:   Particle , which propagates as a straight line.  MagneticParticle , which propagates as a circle instead of a line (similar to electrons in a perpendicular magnetic field).   There are two ways to create a particle. The first one is to provide the constructor with some initial conditions:  x0   =   rand ();   y0   =   rand ();  \u03c60   =   2 \u03c0 * rand ()  p   =   Particle ( x0 ,   y0 ,   \u03c60 )   Particle{Float64}\nposition: [0.690007, 0.201921]\nvelocity: [-0.302733, 0.953075]  To create a  MagneticParticle  simply provide the constructor with one more number, the angular velocity:  \u03c9   =   0.5  mp   =   MagneticParticle ( x0 ,   y0 ,   \u03c60 ,   \u03c9 )   MagneticParticle{Float64}\nposition: [0.690007, 0.201921]\nvelocity: [-0.302733, 0.953075]\nang. velocity: 0.5   Why the  {Float64}  ?  When creating a billiard or a particle, the object is printed with  {Float64}  at the end. This shows what type of numbers are used for  all  numerical operations. If you are curious you can learn more about it in the  numerical precision page .    Particles must be inside the Billiard!  Keep in mind that the particle must be initialized  inside a billiard  for any functionality to work properly and make sense.

The methods provided are:  plot ( bd ,   xmin ,   ymin ,   xmax ,   ymax )  plot ( bd ,   xt :: Vector { T },   yt :: Vector { T })   The last one conveniently plots the combo of particle-trajectory and periodic-billiard taking care of all the details internally.

For example, the following code  using   DynamicalBilliards ,   PyPlot  r   =   0.25  bd   =   billiard_rectangle ( 2 ,   1 ;   setting   =   periodic )  d   =   Disk ([ 0.5 ,   0.5 ],   r )  d2   =   Ellipse ([ 1.5 ,   0.5 ],   r ,   2 r / 3 )  bd   =   Billiard ( bd . obstacles ... ,   d ,   d2 )  p   =   Particle ( 1.0 ,   0.5 ,   0.2 )  xt ,   yt ,   vxt ,   vyt ,   t   =   timeseries! ( p ,   bd ,   10 )  plot ( bd ,   xt ,   yt )  plot ( p )    And, you can also periodically plot billiards with hexagonal periodicity. Only give the keyword argument  hexagonal = true  to  plot .

The \nRaySplitter\n structure\n\n\nIn the second step, you have to define 2+1 functions: transmission probability, refraction angle and optionally new angular velocity after transmission. These functions, as well as which obstacles participate in ray-splitting, are bundled into a special structure:\n\n\n#\n\n\nDynamicalBilliards.RaySplitter\n \n \nType\n.\n\n\nRaySplitter(idxs, transmission, refraction [, newangular]; affect)\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn a \nRaySplitter\n instance, used to perform raysplitting. \nidxs\n is a \nVector{Int}\n with the indices of the obstacles that this \nRaySplitter\n corresponds to.\n\n\ntransmission\n, \nrefraction\n and \nnewangular\n are \nfunctions\n. Let \n\u03c6\n be the angle of incidence and \n\u03c9\n be the angular velocity and \npflag\n the propagation flag (before transmission). The functions have the following signatures:\n\n\n\n\ntransmission(\u03c6, pflag, \u03c9) -\n T\n, transmission probability.\n\n\nrefraction(\u03c6, pflag, \u03c9) -\n \u03b8\n, refraction angle. This angle is \nrelative\n to the normal vector.\n\n\nnewangular(\u03c9, pflag) -\n new\u03c9\n, new angular velocity after transmission.\n\n\n\n\nThe above three functions use the \nsame convention\n: the argument \npflag\n is the one the obstacle has \nbefore transmission\n. For example, if a particle is outside an \nAntidot\n (with \npflag = true\n here) and is transmitted inside the \nAntidot\n (\npflag\n becomes \nfalse\n here), then all three functions will be given their second argument (the Boolean one) as \ntrue\n!\n\n\naffect\n is a function, and denotes which obstacles of the billiard are affected when transmission occurs at obstacle \ni\n (for which obstacles should the field \npflag\n be reversed). Defaults to \nidxs = (i) -\n i\n, i.e. only the colliding obstacle is affected. If you want many obstacles to be affected you could write \nidxs = (i) -\n SVector(2,3,5)\n, etc. Keep in mind that the only values of \ni\n that can be passed into this function are the ones that are given in the argument \nidxs\n!\n\n\nsource\n\n\n\n\nIf you want different type of transmission/refraction functions for different obstacles, then you define multiple \nRaySplitter\ns.\n\n\nContinuing from the above billiard, let's also create some \nRaySplitter\n instances for it.\n\n\nFirst define a refraction function\n\n\nrefraction\n(\n\u03c6\n,\n \npflag\n,\n \n\u03c9\n)\n \n=\n \npflag\n \n?\n \n0.5\n\u03c6\n \n:\n \n2.0\n\u03c6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrefraction (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, a transmission probability function. In this example, we want to create a function that given some factor \np\n, it returns a probability weighted with \np\n in one direction of ray-splitting and \n1-p\n in another direction.\n\n\ntransmission_p\n(\np\n)\n \n=\n \n(\n\u03c6\n,\n \npflag\n,\n \n\u03c9\n)\n \n-\n \nbegin\n\n    \nif\n \npflag\n\n        \np\n*\nexp\n(\n-\n(\n\u03c6\n)\n^\n2\n/\n2\n(\n\u03c0\n/\n8\n)\n^\n2\n)\n\n    \nelse\n\n        \nabs\n(\n\u03c6\n)\n \n \n\u03c0\n/\n4\n \n?\n \n(\n1\n-\np\n)\n*\nexp\n(\n-\n(\n\u03c6\n)\n^\n2\n/\n2\n(\n\u03c0\n/\n4\n)\n^\n2\n)\n \n:\n \n0.0\n\n    \nend\n\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntransmission_p (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice also how we defined the function in such a way that critical refraction is respected, i.e. if \n\u03b8(\u03c6) \u2265 \u03c0/2\n then \nT(\u03c6) = 0\n. Although this is necessary from a physical perspective, the code does take care of it by clamping the refraction angle (see below).\n\n\nLastly, for this example we will use magnetic propagation. We define functions such that the antidots also reverse the direction and magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\n\nnewoantidot\n(\nx\n,\n \nbool\n)\n \n=\n  \nbool\n \n?\n \n-\n2.0\nx\n \n:\n \n-\n0.5\nx\n\n\nnewowall\n(\nx\n,\n \nbool\n)\n \n=\n \nbool\n \n?\n \n0.5\nx\n \n:\n \n2.0\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnewowall (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we create the \nRaySplitter\n instances we want\n\n\nraywall\n \n=\n \nRaySplitter\n([\n3\n],\n \ntransmission_p\n(\n0.5\n),\n \nrefraction\n,\n \nnewowall\n)\n\n\nraya\n \n=\n \nRaySplitter\n([\n1\n,\n \n2\n],\n \ntransmission_p\n(\n0.8\n),\n \nrefraction\n,\n \nnewoantidot\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaySplitter for indices [1, 2]\n transmission: getfield(Main.ex-ray, Symbol(\n##1#2\n)){Float64}(0.8)\n refraction:   Main.ex-ray.refraction\n new angular:  Main.ex-ray.newoantidot\n affect:       default\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause we want to use same functions for both antidots, we gave both indices in \nraya\n, \n[1, 2]\n (which are the indices of the antidots in the billiard \nbd\n).\n\n\n\n\n3. Evolution with Ray-Splitting\n\n\nThe third step is trivial. After you have created your \nRaySplitter\n(s), you simply pass them into \nevolve\n or \nanimate_evolution\n as a fourth argument! If you have many instances of \nRaySplitter\n you pass a tuple of them.\n\n\nFor example,\n\n\np\n \n=\n \nrandominside\n(\nbd\n,\n \n1.0\n)\n\n\nraysplitters\n \n=\n \n(\nraywall\n,\n \nraya\n)\n\n\nxt\n,\n \nyt\n,\n \nvxt\n,\n \nvyt\n,\n \ntt\n \n=\n \ntimeseries\n(\np\n,\n \nbd\n,\n \n100\n,\n \nraysplitters\n)\n\n\nplot\n(\nbd\n)\n\n\nplot\n(\nxt\n,\n \nyt\n)\n\n\nscatter\n(\nxt\n[\n1\n],\n \nyt\n[\n1\n],\n \ncolor\n \n=\n \nblack\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that at some points the particle crossed the boundaries of the red obstacles, which allow for ray splitting. It is even cooler to animate this motion using \nanimate_evolution\n!\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nResetting the billiard\n\n\nNotice that evolving a particle inside a billiard always mutates the billiard if ray-splitting is used. This means that you should always set the fields \npflag\n of some obstacles to the values you desire after \neach\n call to \nevolve\n. If you use the function \nrandominside\n you must definitely do this!\n\n\nThe function \nreset_billiard!(bd)\n turns all \npflag\ns to \ntrue\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAngle of refraction is clamped\n\n\nInternally we clamp the output of the angle of refraction function to \n-\u03c0/2 + 0.1 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0/2 - 0.1\n. This is so that the relocating algorithm does not fall into an infinite loop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ray-Splitting Algorithm\n\n\nIn this section we describe the algorithm we follow to implement the ray-splitting process. Let \nT\nT\n denote the transmission function, \n\\theta\n\\theta\n the refraction function and \n\\omega_{\\text{new}}\n\\omega_{\\text{new}}\n the new angular velocity function. The following describes the process after a particle has reached an obstacle that supports ray-splitting.\n\n\n\n\nFind the angle of incidence \n\\phi' = \\pi - \\arccos(\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{n}) = \\arccos(\\vec{v} \\cdot (-\\vec{n}))\n\\phi' = \\pi - \\arccos(\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{n}) = \\arccos(\\vec{v} \\cdot (-\\vec{n}))\n with \n\\vec{n}\n\\vec{n}\n the normal vector at collision point. Notice that we use here \n-\\vec{n}\n-\\vec{n}\n because the velocity is opposing the normal vector before the collision happens. Using \n-\\vec{n}\n-\\vec{n}\n gives the angle between 0 and \n\\pi/2\n\\pi/2\n instead of \n\\pi/2\n\\pi/2\n to \n\\pi\n\\pi\n.\n\n\nFind the \ncorrect\n sign of the incidence angle, \n\\phi = \\pm \\phi'\n\\phi = \\pm \\phi'\n. Specifically, use the cross product: if the third entry of \n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{n}\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{n}\n is negative, then have minus sign. The \"correct\" sign debates on whether the velocity vector is to the right or to the left of \n(-\\vec{n})\n(-\\vec{n})\n. This is important for finding the correct transmission angle and/or probability.\n\n\nCheck if \nT(\\phi, \\verb|pflag|, \\omega) \n \\text{random}()\nT(\\phi, \\verb|pflag|, \\omega) > \\text{random}()\n. If not, do standard specular reflection.\n\n\nIf ray-splitting happens, then relocate the particle so that it is on the \nother\n side of the colliding obstacle. This contrasts the main evolution algorithm of this billiard package.\n\n\nRe-compute the \ncorrect\n angle of incidence, as the position of the particle generally changes with relocating.\n\n\nFind refraction angle \n\\theta(\\phi, \\verb|pflag|, \\omega)\n\\theta(\\phi, \\verb|pflag|, \\omega)\n. Notice that this is a relative angle with respect to the normal vector. Also notice that \n\\theta\n\\theta\n may have opposite sign from \n\\phi\n\\phi\n. It depends on the user if they want to add anomalous refraction.\n\n\nSet \nobstacle.pflag = !obstacle.pflag\n for \nall\n obstacles affected by the current \nRaySplitter\n. This reverses \n\\vec{n}\n\\vec{n}\n to \n-\\vec{n}\n-\\vec{n}\n as well! So from now on \n\\vec{n}\n\\vec{n}\n is the opposite than what it was at the beginning of the algorithm!\n\n\nFind the refraction angle in absolute space. First find \na = \\text{atan}(n_y, n_x)\na = \\text{atan}(n_y, n_x)\n and then set \n\\Theta = a + \\theta\n\\Theta = a + \\theta\n.\n\n\nPerform refraction, i.e. set the particle velocity to the direction of \n\\Theta\n\\Theta\n.\n\n\nScale the magnetic field, i.e. set \np.omega\n = \n\\omega_{\\text{new}}(\\omega, \\verb|!pflag|)\n\\omega_{\\text{new}}(\\omega, \\verb|!pflag|)\n. It is important to note that we use \n!pflag\n because we have already changed the \npflag\n field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysics of the Ray-Splitting Functions\n\n\nIf \nT\n is the transmission probability function, then the condition for transmission is simply: \nT(\u03c6, pflag, \u03c9) \n rand()\n. If it returns \ntrue\n, transmission (i.e. ray-splitting) will happen.\n\n\nThe functions given to \nRaySplitter\n should have some properties in order to have physical meaning. In order to test if the \nRaySplitter\n you have defined has physical meaning, the function \nisphysical\n is provided\n\n\n#\n\n\nDynamicalBilliards.isphysical\n \n \nFunction\n.\n\n\nisphysical(raysplitter(s))\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn \ntrue\n if the given \nraysplitters\n have physically plausible properties.\n\n\nSpecifically, check if (\u03c6 is the incidence angle, \u03b8 the refraction angle):\n\n\n\n\nCritical angle means total reflection: If \u03b8(\u03c6) \u2265 \u03c0/2 then Tr(\u03c6) = 0\n\n\nTransmission probability is even function: Tr(\u03c6) \u2248 Tr(-\u03c6) at \u03c9 = 0\n\n\nRefraction angle is odd function: \u03b8(\u03c6) \u2248 -\u03b8(-\u03c6) at \u03c9 = 0\n\n\nRay reversal is true: \u03b8(\u03b8(\u03c6, pflag, \u03c9), !pflag, \u03c9) \u2248 \u03c6\n\n\nMagnetic conservation is true: (\u03c9\nnew(\u03c9\nnew(\u03c9, pflag), !pflag) \u2248 \u03c9\n\n\n\n\nsource\n\n\n\n\nExample of Affecting Multiple Obstacles\n\n\nHere we will show an application of \ninverse\n billiards, where particles go in and out of a billiard, while taking advantage of the existence of a magnetic field outside to return.\n\n\nAs always, we define the ray-splitting functions:\n\n\nusing\n \nDynamicalBilliards\n,\n \nPyPlot\n\n\ntrans\n(\nargs\n...\n)\n \n=\n \n1.0\n \n# always perfect transmission\n\n\nrefra\n(\n\u03c6\n,\n \npflag\n,\n \n\u03c9\n)\n \n=\n \npflag\n \n?\n \n0.8\n\u03c6\n \n:\n \n1.25\n\u03c6\n \n# refraction angle\n\n\nneww\n(\n\u03c9\n,\n \npflag\n)\n \n=\n \npflag\n \n?\n \n2.0\n \n:\n \n0.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nneww (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, when we define the \nRaySplitter\n instance we will choose a different value for \naffect\n:\n\n\nray\n \n=\n \nRaySplitter\n([\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n,\n4\n],\n \ntrans\n,\n \nrefra\n,\n \nneww\n,\n \naffect\n \n=\n \n(\ni\n)\n \n-\n \nSVector\n(\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n,\n4\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaySplitter for indices [1, 2, 3, 4]\n transmission: Main.ex-ray.trans\n refraction:   Main.ex-ray.refra\n new angular:  Main.ex-ray.neww\n affect:       getfield(Main.ex-ray, Symbol(\n##3#4\n))()\n\n\n\n\n\nWe initialize a simple rectangular billiard and a particle\n\n\nbd\n \n=\n \nbilliard_rectangle\n(\nsetting\n \n=\n \nray-splitting\n)\n\n\np\n \n=\n \nMagneticParticle\n(\n0.4\n,\n \n0.6\n,\n \n0.0\n,\n \n0.4\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagneticParticle{Float64}\nposition: [0.4, 0.6]\nvelocity: [1.0, 0.0]\nang. velocity: 0.4\n\n\n\n\n\nand we animate its evolution, by first zooming out of the billiard\n\n\nplot\n(\nbd\n)\n\n\nxlim\n(\n-\n1\n,\n \n2\n);\n \nylim\n(\n-\n1\n,\n \n2\n);\n\n\nanimate_evolution\n(\np\n,\n \nbd\n,\n \n10.0\n,\n \n(\nray\n,);\n \nax\n \n=\n \ngca\n(),\n \nsavename\n \n=\n \ninverse\n,\n \ntailtime\n \n=\n \n3.0\n)",

Continuing from the above billiard, let's also create some  RaySplitter  instances for it.

It is even cooler to animate this motion using  animate_evolution !        Resetting the billiard  Notice that evolving a particle inside a billiard always mutates the billiard if ray-splitting is used. This means that you should always set the fields  pflag  of some obstacles to the values you desire after  each  call to  evolve . If you use the function  randominside  you must definitely do this!  The function  reset_billiard!(bd)  turns all  pflag s to  true .    Angle of refraction is clamped  Internally we clamp the output of the angle of refraction function to  -\u03c0/2 + 0.1 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0/2 - 0.1 . This is so that the relocating algorithm does not fall into an infinite loop.",

            "text": "In this section we describe the algorithm we follow to implement the ray-splitting process. Let  T T  denote the transmission function,  \\theta \\theta  the refraction function and  \\omega_{\\text{new}} \\omega_{\\text{new}}  the new angular velocity function. The following describes the process after a particle has reached an obstacle that supports ray-splitting.   Find the angle of incidence  \\phi' = \\pi - \\arccos(\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{n}) = \\arccos(\\vec{v} \\cdot (-\\vec{n})) \\phi' = \\pi - \\arccos(\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{n}) = \\arccos(\\vec{v} \\cdot (-\\vec{n}))  with  \\vec{n} \\vec{n}  the normal vector at collision point. Notice that we use here  -\\vec{n} -\\vec{n}  because the velocity is opposing the normal vector before the collision happens. Using  -\\vec{n} -\\vec{n}  gives the angle between 0 and  \\pi/2 \\pi/2  instead of  \\pi/2 \\pi/2  to  \\pi \\pi .  Find the  correct  sign of the incidence angle,  \\phi = \\pm \\phi' \\phi = \\pm \\phi' . Specifically, use the cross product: if the third entry of  \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{n} \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{n}  is negative, then have minus sign. The \"correct\" sign debates on whether the velocity vector is to the right or to the left of  (-\\vec{n}) (-\\vec{n}) . This is important for finding the correct transmission angle and/or probability.  Check if  T(\\phi, \\verb|pflag|, \\omega)   \\text{random}() T(\\phi, \\verb|pflag|, \\omega) > \\text{random}() . If not, do standard specular reflection.  If ray-splitting happens, then relocate the particle so that it is on the  other  side of the colliding obstacle. This contrasts the main evolution algorithm of this billiard package.  Re-compute the  correct  angle of incidence, as the position of the particle generally changes with relocating.  Find refraction angle  \\theta(\\phi, \\verb|pflag|, \\omega) \\theta(\\phi, \\verb|pflag|, \\omega) . Notice that this is a relative angle with respect to the normal vector. Also notice that  \\theta \\theta  may have opposite sign from  \\phi \\phi . It depends on the user if they want to add anomalous refraction.  Set  obstacle.pflag = !obstacle.pflag  for  all  obstacles affected by the current  RaySplitter . This reverses  \\vec{n} \\vec{n}  to  -\\vec{n} -\\vec{n}  as well! So from now on  \\vec{n} \\vec{n}  is the opposite than what it was at the beginning of the algorithm!  Find the refraction angle in absolute space. First find  a = \\text{atan}(n_y, n_x) a = \\text{atan}(n_y, n_x)  and then set  \\Theta = a + \\theta \\Theta = a + \\theta .  Perform refraction, i.e. set the particle velocity to the direction of  \\Theta \\Theta .  Scale the magnetic field, i.e. set  p.omega  =  \\omega_{\\text{new}}(\\omega, \\verb|!pflag|) \\omega_{\\text{new}}(\\omega, \\verb|!pflag|) . It is important to note that we use  !pflag  because we have already changed the  pflag  field.",

However, for the example of this page, we will create a hexagonal billiard with a disk in the middle step-by-step.\n\n\nThe first step is to define the six walls of the billiard table. An \nInfiniteWall\n object needs to be supplemented with a start point, an end point, a normal vector and, optionally, a name.\n\n\nThe vertex points of a regular hexagon of radius \nr\n are given by the formula:\n\n\n\n\n\n(x,y) = \\left( r\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{6}\\right), r\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{6}\\right) \\right)\\,, \\quad \\text{for i $\\in$ \\{1,...,6\\}}\n\n\n\n\n(x,y) = \\left( r\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{6}\\right), r\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{6}\\right) \\right)\\,, \\quad \\text{for i $\\in$ \\{1,...,6\\}}\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create each wall object, we will implement the following loop:\n\n\nhexagon_vertex\n \n=\n \n(\nr\n)\n \n-\n \n[\n \n[\nr\n*\ncos\n(\n2\n\u03c0\n*\ni\n/\n6\n),\n \nr\n*\nsin\n(\n2\n\u03c0\n*\ni\n/\n6\n)]\n \nfor\n \ni\n \nin\n \n1\n:\n6\n]\n\n\nhexver\n \n=\n \nhexagon_vertex\n(\n2.0\n)\n\n\n\nfor\n \ni\n \nin\n \neachindex\n(\nhexver\n)\n\n  \nstarting\n \n=\n \nhexver\n[\ni\n]\n\n  \nending\n \n=\n \nhexver\n[\nmod1\n(\ni\n+\n1\n,\n \nlength\n(\nhexver\n))]\n\n  \nw\n \n=\n \nending\n \n-\n \nstarting\n\n  \nnormal\n \n=\n \n[\n-\nw\n[\n2\n],\n \nw\n[\n1\n]]\n\n  \nwall\n \n=\n \nInfiniteWall\n(\nstarting\n,\n \nending\n,\n \nnormal\n,\n \nwall \n$i\n)\n\n  \npush!\n(\nbd\n,\n \nwall\n)\n\n\nend\n\n\n\nsummary\n(\nbd\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-element Array{Obstacle{Float64},1}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nnormal\n vector of a \nWall\n obstacle is necessary to be supplemented by the user because it must point towards where the particle is expected to come from.

Both are normal to \nw\n, but you have to know which one to pick. In this case this is very easy, since the normal has to simply point towards the origin.\n\n\nWe add a disk by specifying a center and radius (and optionally a name):\n\n\nd\n \n=\n \nDisk\n([\n0\n,\n0\n],\n \n0.8\n)\n\n\npush!\n(\nbd\n,\n \nd\n)\n\n\n# Make the structure required:\n\n\nbilliard\n \n=\n \nBilliard\n(\nbd\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBilliard{Float64} with 7 obstacles:\n  wall 1\n  wall 2\n  wall 3\n  wall 4\n  wall 5\n  wall 6\n  Disk\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make sure the billiard looks as you would expect, use the function \nplot(bd)\n.

To expand this to ray-splitting you have to use ray-splitting \nObstacle\ns (\nsee the tutorial on Ray-Splitting\n).

            "text": "#  DynamicalBilliards.Billiard     Type .  Billiard(obstacles...)  Construct a  Billiard  from given  obstacles  (tuple, vector, varargs).  For functions like  boundarymap , it is expected (if possible) that the obstacles of the billiard are sorted, such that the arc-coordinate  \u03be  around the billiard is increasing counter-clockwise.  \u03be  is measured as:   the distance from start point to end point in  Wall s  the arc length measured counterclockwise from the open face in  Semicircle s  the arc length measured counterclockwise from the rightmost point in  Circular s   source   A  Billiard  is a wrapper of a  Tuple  of  Obstacle s. The abstract Type  Obstacle{T}  is the supertype of all objects that a particle may collide with, with global billiard precision of type  T .  There are many premade functions that construct well-known billiards, like the periodic Sinai billiard. You can find all of them at the  Standard Billiards Library .  To create a custom billiard from scratch, it is often convenient to start with an empty  Vector{Obstacle{T}} :  using   DynamicalBilliards  bd   =   Obstacle { Float64 }[]    # T : AbstractFloat   0-element Array{Obstacle{Float64},1}  and then you create your obstacles one by one and add them to it. All obstacles that are already defined in the package can be found at the  Obstacles page  of the library. The function  billiard_polygon  creates a polygonal billiard table. However, for the example of this page, we will create a hexagonal billiard with a disk in the middle step-by-step.  The first step is to define the six walls of the billiard table. An  InfiniteWall  object needs to be supplemented with a start point, an end point, a normal vector and, optionally, a name.  The vertex points of a regular hexagon of radius  r  are given by the formula:   \n(x,y) = \\left( r\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{6}\\right), r\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{6}\\right) \\right)\\,, \\quad \\text{for i $\\in$ \\{1,...,6\\}}  \n(x,y) = \\left( r\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{6}\\right), r\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{6}\\right) \\right)\\,, \\quad \\text{for i $\\in$ \\{1,...,6\\}}   To create each wall object, we will implement the following loop:  hexagon_vertex   =   ( r )   -   [   [ r * cos ( 2 \u03c0 * i / 6 ),   r * sin ( 2 \u03c0 * i / 6 )]   for   i   in   1 : 6 ]  hexver   =   hexagon_vertex ( 2.0 )  for   i   in   eachindex ( hexver ) \n   starting   =   hexver [ i ] \n   ending   =   hexver [ mod1 ( i + 1 ,   length ( hexver ))] \n   w   =   ending   -   starting \n   normal   =   [ - w [ 2 ],   w [ 1 ]] \n   wall   =   InfiniteWall ( starting ,   ending ,   normal ,   wall  $i ) \n   push! ( bd ,   wall )  end  summary ( bd )   6-element Array{Obstacle{Float64},1}   The  normal  vector of a  Wall  obstacle is necessary to be supplemented by the user because it must point towards where the particle is expected to come from. If  w  is the vector (wall) pointing from start- to end-point then the vector  [-w[2], w[1]]  is pointing to the left of  w  and the vector  [w[2], -[w1]]  is pointing to the right. Both are normal to  w , but you have to know which one to pick. In this case this is very easy, since the normal has to simply point towards the origin.  We add a disk by specifying a center and radius (and optionally a name):  d   =   Disk ([ 0 , 0 ],   0.8 )  push! ( bd ,   d )  # Make the structure required:  billiard   =   Billiard ( bd )   Billiard{Float64} with 7 obstacles:\n  wall 1\n  wall 2\n  wall 3\n  wall 4\n  wall 5\n  wall 6\n  Disk  To make sure the billiard looks as you would expect, use the function  plot(bd) . Create a particle inside that billiard and evolve it:  using   PyPlot  plot ( billiard )  \u03c9   =   0.5  p   =   randominside ( billiard ,   \u03c9 )  xt ,   yt ,   vxt ,   vyt ,   t   =   timeseries! ( p ,   billiard ,   100 )  plot ( xt ,   yt )  plot ( p )    The billiard table now works for straight or magnetic propagation. To expand this to ray-splitting you have to use ray-splitting  Obstacle s ( see the tutorial on Ray-Splitting ). Additional information on how to define your own  Obstacle  sub-type is given in the tutorial on  Defining your own Obstacles .  If you make  any  billiard system that you think is cool and missing from this package, you are more than welcome to submit a PR extending the Standard Billiards Library with your contribution!",

You can however define custom methods for  DynamicalBilliards.specular! , which is what we have done e.g. for  RandomDisk .   Use  import !  Notice that you have to properly  import  the methods to extend them. For example, do  import DynamicalBilliards: normalvec, distance, collision  time.   The first method is very simple, just do:  import   DynamicalBilliards :   normalvec ,   distance ,   collision  normalvec ( d :: Semicircle ,   pos )   =   normalize ( d . c   -   pos )   Since the function is only used during  distance  and  DynamicalBilliards.resolvecollision!  and since we will be writing explicit methods for the first, we don't have to care about what happens when the particle is far away from the boundary.

That is because when the particle is on the \"open\" half of the disk, the distance is not correct. We write:  SV   =   SVector { 2 }   #convenience  function   distance ( pos :: AbstractVector { T },   s :: Semicircle { T })   where   { T } \n     # Check on which half of circle is the particle \n     v1   =   pos   .-   s . c \n     nn   =   dot ( v1 ,   s . facedir ) \n     if   nn   \u2264   0   # I am  inside semicircle \n         return   s . r   -   norm ( pos   -   s . c ) \n     else   # I am on the  other side \n         end1   =   SV ( s . c [ 1 ]   +   s . r * s . facedir [ 2 ],   s . c [ 2 ]   -   s . r * s . facedir [ 1 ]) \n         end2   =   SV ( s . c [ 1 ]   -   s . r * s . facedir [ 2 ],   s . c [ 2 ]   +   s . r * s . facedir [ 1 ]) \n         return   min ( norm ( pos   -   end1 ),   norm ( pos   -   end2 )) \n     end  end   Notice that this definition always returns positive distance when the particle is on the \"other side\".

But, with pen, paper and a significant amount of patience, one can find a way:  function   collision ( p :: Particle { T },   d :: Semicircle { T }) :: T   where   { T } \n\n     dc   =   p . pos   -   d . c \n     B   =   dot ( p . vel ,   dc )           #velocity towards circle center: B   0 \n     C   =   dot ( dc ,   dc )   -   d . r * d . r      #being outside of circle: C   0 \n     \u0394   =   B ^ 2   -   C \n\n     \u0394   \u2264   0     return   nocollision ( T ) \n     sqrtD   =   sqrt ( \u0394 ) \n\n     nn   =   dot ( dc ,   d . facedir ) \n     if   nn   \u2265   0   # I am NOT inside semicircle \n         # Return most positive time \n         t   =   - B   +   sqrtD \n     else   # I am inside semicircle: \n         t   =   - B   -   sqrtD \n         # these lines make sure that the code works for ANY starting position: \n         if   t   \u2264   0   ||   distance ( p ,   d )   \u2264   accuracy ( T ) \n             t   =   - B   +   sqrtD \n         end \n     end \n     # This check is necessary to not collide with the non-existing side \n     newpos   =   p . pos   +   p . vel   *   t \n     if   dot ( newpos   -   d . c ,   d . facedir )   \u2265   0   # collision point on BAD HALF; \n         return   nocollision ( T ) \n     end \n     # If collision time is negative, return Inf: \n     t   \u2264   0.0   ?   nocollision ( T )   :   ( t ,   p . pos   +   t * p . vel )  end   And that is all. The obstacle now works perfectly fine for straight propagation.   Ray-Splitting support  Supporting ray-splitting for your custom obstacle is very easy. The first step is to give it a field called  pflag , which is a  Bool . The second step is to ensure that  collisiontime  works properly for particles coming from both directions of the obstacle! Both inside or outside! This is implemented for  Ellipse  in Pull Request  #159 .",

For this, the method has to accept an argument of type  Vector{SVector{4, T}} , which contains the four perturbation vectors corresponding to the four Lyapunov exponents.  Finding a formula for the evolution of the perturbations requires some tricky calculations. Fortunately for us, the results for general circular obstacles were already determined by Dellago, Posch and Hoover [1] \u2013 we just have to implement them.  function   specular!
