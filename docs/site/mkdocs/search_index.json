            "text": "Basic Usage\n\n\nDynamicalBilliards.jl\n was created with easy-of-use as its main cornerstone.  With 3 simple steps, the user can fully initalize, evolve, and get the output of the propagation of a particle in a billiard system.\n\n\nIn general, the workflow of \nDynamicalBilliards.jl\n follows these simple steps:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a billiard table, a \nVector{Obstacle}\n.\n\n\nCreate a particle inside that billiard table.\n\n\nGet the output by evolving the particle.\n\n\n\n\nAdding more complexity in your billiard table does not add complexity in your code. For example, to implement a ray-splitting billiard you only need to define one additional variable, a dictionary \nDict{Int, Vector{Function}}\n. After reading through this basic usage page,  you will be able to use all aspects of \nDynamicalBilliards.jl\n with minimal effort.\n\n\n\n\nStraight Propagation\n\n\n\n\nThe usage of this package revolves around a single function: \n\n\nevolve!\n(\np\n::\nAbstractParticle\n,\n \nbt\n::\nVector\n{\nObstacle\n},\n \ntotal_time\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich evolves a particle \np\n inside a billiard table \nbt\n for a given amount of time \ntotal_time\n,  while taking care of all the details internally. \n\n\nThe first step is to define the billiard table \nbt\n, which is the system the particle \np\n will propagate in.  A billiard table is simply a collection (\nVector\n) of \nObstacle\ns. The most convenient way is to use  one of the pre-defined billiard tables offered by the package. For example, let's create a periodic Sinai  billiard with disk radius of 0.3 and with one side of length 2 and one of length 1:\n\n\nusing\n \nDynamicalBilliards\n\n\nbt\n \n=\n \nbilliard_sinai\n(\n0.3\n,\n \n2.0\n,\n \n1.0\n;\n \nperiodic\n=\ntrue\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(for more information about defining billiard tables visit the \ntutorial on defining your own billiard table\n)\n\n\nAfterwards, you want to create a particle inside that billiard system.  For that, the function \nrandominside(bt::Vector{Obstacle})\n is provided.  This function returns a particle with random initial conditions inside the billiard table,  while making sure that it is always in the allowed region of the billiard table.\n\n\np\n \n=\n \nrandominside\n(\nbt\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to specify the initial conditions yourself, simply pass them to the \nParticle\n constructor, like \np = Particle(x0, y0, \u03c60)\n. Now you are ready to evolve this particle:\n\n\nct\n,\n \nposs\n,\n \nvels\n \n=\n \nevolve!\n(\np\n,\n \nbt\n,\n \n1000.0\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe return values of the \nevolve!()\n function need some brief explaining: As noted by the \"!\" at the end of the function,  it changes its argument \np\n. Most importantly however, this function also returns the main output expected by a billiard system. This output is a tuple of three vectors:\n\n\n\n\nct::Vector\n : Collision times.\n\n\nposs::Vector{SVector{2}}\n : Positions during collisions.\n\n\nvels:: Vector{SVector{2}})\n : Velocities \nexactly after\n the collisions (i.e. reflections).\n\n\n\n\nThe time \nt[i]\n is the time necessary to reach state \nposs[i], vels[i]\n starting from the state \nposs[i-1], vels[i-1]\n. That is why \nt[1]\n is always 0 since \nposs[1], vels[1]\n are the initial conditions.\n\n\nIf this output is not convenient for you, the function \nconstruct(ct, poss, vels)\n is provided,  which constructs the (continuous) timeseries of the position and velocity, as well as the time-vector, when given the main output of \nevolve!()\n:\n\n\nxt\n,\n \nyt\n,\n \nvxt\n,\n \nvyt\n,\n \nts\n \n=\n \nconstruct\n(\nct\n,\n \nposs\n,\n \nvels\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor, by taking advantage of the awesome ellipsis operator, you can do:\n\n\nxt\n,\n \nyt\n,\n \nvxt\n,\n \nvyt\n,\n \nts\n \n=\n \nconstruct\n(\nevolve!\n(\np\n,\n \nbt\n,\n \n1000.0\n)\n...\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagnetic Propagation\n\n\n\n\nThe are only two differences between magnetic and straight propagation.  Firstly, the particle type is not \nParticle\n anymore, but \nMagneticParticle\n.  The latter has an extra field called \nomega\n which is the cyclic frequency of rotation  (equivalently, the angular velocity). In order to create a \nMagneticParticle\n (without using the constructors),  you simply provide this extra information to the \nrandominside()\n function:\n\n\n\u03c9\n \n=\n \n0.5\n\n\np\n \n=\n \nrandominside\n(\nbt\n,\n \n\u03c9\n)\n\n\ntypeof\n(\np\n)\n \n# MagneticParticle\n\n\np\n.\nomega\n   \n# 0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo propagate the particle you use the same functions:\n\n\nct\n,\n \nposs\n,\n \nvels\n,\n \n\u03c9\n \n=\n \nevolve!\n(\np\n,\n \nbt\n,\n \n1000.0\n)\n  \n#evolve for magnetic also returns \u03c9\n\n\nxt\n,\n \nyt\n,\n \nvxt\n,\n \nvyt\n,\n \nts\n \n=\n \nconstruct\n(\nct\n,\n \nposs\n,\n \nvels\n,\n \n\u03c9\n,\n \ndt\n)\n\n\n# or equivalently: \n\n\nxt\n,\n \nyt\n,\n \nvxt\n,\n \nvyt\n,\n \nts\n \n=\n \nconstruct\n(\nevolve!\n(\np\n,\n \nbt\n,\n \n1000.0\n)\n...\n,\n \ndt\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the second difference is that the additional argument of the angular velocity must also be provided  to the \nconstruct()\n function, in order for it to construct circular motion instead of straight motion between collisions.  (Note: \nevolve!()\n returns 4 arguments for magnetic propagation, making the ellipsis syntax extremely useful!).\n\n\nThe final optional argument \ndt\n is the time-step at which the timeseries are constructed  (since they are made up of sines and cosines).\n\n\n\n\nRay-Splitting\n\n\n\n\nNo matter how complex ray-splitting processes you want, and irrespectively of how many obstacles in the billiard table can perform ray-splitting, there is only a single difference on the main function call: The \nevolve!()\n function is supplemented with a fourth argument, called \"ray_splitter\":\n\n\nray_splitter\n::\nDict\n{\nInt\n,\n \nVector\n{\nFunction\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis argument is simply a dictionary which handles all ray-splitting processes in the billiard system. It is a map of the Obstacle index within the billiard table to the ray-splitting functions: (\u03c6 is the angle of incidence)\n\n\n\n\nT(\u03c6, where, \u03c9) : Transmission probability.\n\n\n\u03b8(\u03c6, where, \u03c9) : Transmission (aka diffraction) angle.\n\n\nnew_\u03c9(\u03c9, where) : Angular velocity after transmission.\n\n\n\n\nAssuming you have defined a billiard table and a ray-splitter dictionary, the implementation is exactly the same as in the two previous cases: the ray-splitting dictionary is passed to \nevolve!()\n as a fourth argument.\n\n\nray_splitter\n \n=\n \nDict\n(\n5\n \n=\n \n[\nfoo\n,\n \nbar\n,\n \nbaz\n])\n\n\np\n \n=\n \nrandominside\n(\nbt\n,\n \n4.0\n)\n\n\nxt\n,\n \nyt\n,\n \nvxt\n,\n \nvyt\n,\n \nts\n \n=\n \nconstruct\n(\nevolve!\n(\np\n,\n \nbt\n,\n \n100.0\n,\n \nray_splitter\n)\n...\n,\n \ndt\n \n=\n \n0.01\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information and instructions on defining the \"ray_splitter\" dictionary visit the \nRay-Splitting tutorial here\n.\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing\n\n\n\n\n(all plotting in\n \nDynamicalBilliards\n \nis currently done through the\n \nPyPlot\n \npackage. In a future update a switch will happen towards\n \nPlots.jl\n \n)\n\n\nThe functions \nplot_obstacle(o::Obstacle; kwargs...)\n, \nplot_billiard(bt::Vector{Obstacle}; kwargs...)\n and \nplot_particle(p::AbstractParticle; kwargs...)\n are provided in order to plot the respective elements \non the current PyPlot figure\n.

Then, it draws the collisions, drawing always only the last \ncol_to_plot\n collisions with orbit color \ncolor\n.  \nsleeptime\n signals the waiting time between each plot update.\n\n\nDirect animation saving is not supported yet.

The abstract Type \nObstacle\n is the supertype of all objects that a particle may collide with.\n\n\nThere are many premade functions that construct well-known billiards, like the periodic Sinai billiard. You can find all of them at the \nStandard Billiards page\n.\n\n\nTo create a custom billiard, you start with an empty Vector:\n\n\nbt = Obstacle[]\n\n\n\n\n\nand then you create your obstacles one by one and add them to it. All obstacles that are already defined in the package can be found at the \nObstacles page\n of the library. The function \nbilliard_polygon\n creates a polygonal billiard table.  However, for the example of this page, we will create a hexagonal billiard with a disk in the middle step-by-step.\n\n\nThe first step is to define the six walls of the billiard table. A \nInfiniteWall\n object needs to be supplemented with a start point, an end point, a normal vector and, optionally, a name. The vertex points of a regular hexagon of radius \nr\n are given by the formula:\n\n\n$$\n(x,y) = \\left( r\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{6}\\right), r\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{6}\\right) \\right)\\,, \\quad \\text{for i $\\in$ {1,...,6}}\n$$\n\n\nTo create each wall object, we will implement the following loop, choosing a size of 2.0:\n\n\nusing\n \nDynamicalBilliards\n\n\nhexagon_vertex\n \n=\n \n(\nr\n)\n \n-\n \n[\n \n[\nr\n*\ncos\n(\n2\n\u03c0\n*\ni\n/\n6\n),\n \nr\n*\nsin\n(\n2\n\u03c0\n*\ni\n/\n6\n)]\n \nfor\n \ni\n \nin\n \n1\n:\n6\n]\n\n\nhexver\n \n=\n \nhexagon_vertex\n(\n2.0\n)\n\n\n\nfor\n \ni\n \nin\n \neachindex\n(\nhexver\n)\n\n  \nstarting\n \n=\n \nhexver\n[\ni\n]\n\n  \nending\n \n=\n \nhexver\n[\nmod1\n(\ni\n+\n1\n,\n \nlength\n(\nhexver\n))]\n\n  \nw\n \n=\n \nending\n \n-\n \nstarting\n\n  \nnormal\n \n=\n \n[\n-\nw\n[\n2\n],\n \nw\n[\n1\n]]\n\n  \nwall\n \n=\n \nInfiniteWall\n(\nstarting\n,\n \nending\n,\n \nnormal\n,\n \nwall \n$i\n)\n\n  \npush!\n(\nbt\n,\n \nwall\n)\n\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nnormal\n vector of a \nWall\n obstacle is necessary to be supplemented by the user because it must point towards where the particle is expected to come from. If \nw\n is the vector (wall) pointing from start- to end-point then the vector \n[-w[2], w[1]]\n is pointing to the left of \nw\n and the vector \n[w[2], -[w1]]\n is pointing to the right. Both are normal to \nw\n, but you have to know which one to pick. In this case this is very easy, since the normal has to simply point towards the origin.\n\n\nWe add a disk by specifying a center and radius (and optionally a name): \n\n\nd\n \n=\n \nDisk\n([\n0\n,\n0\n],\n \n0.8\n)\n\n\npush!\n(\nbt\n,\n \nd\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make sure the billiard looks as you would expect, use the function \nplot_billiard(bt)\n. Create a particle inside that billiard and evolve it:\n\n\nplot_billiard\n(\nbt\n)\n\n\n\u03c9\n \n=\n \n0.5\n\n\np\n \n=\n \nrandominside\n(\np\n,\n \n\u03c9\n)\n\n\nxt\n,\n \nyt\n,\n \nvxt\n,\n \nvyt\n,\n \nt\n \n=\n \nconstruct\n(\nevolve!\n(\np\n,\n \nbt\n,\n \n100\n)\n...\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe billiard table now works for straight or magnetic propagation.  To expand this to ray-splitting you have to use ray-splitting Obstacles (\nsee the tutorial on Ray-Splitting\n).  Additional information on how to define your own \nObstacle\n sub-type is given in the tutorial on \nCefining your own Obstacles\n.\n\n\nIf you make any billiard system that you think is common and missing from this package, you are more than welcome to submit a PR extending the \nStandardBilliards.jl\n library with your contribution!",

            "text": "Ray-Splitting\n\n\nRay-splitting is a semiclassical approach to the billiard system, giving a wave attribute to the ray traced by the particle. Upon collision a particle may propagate through an obstacle (transmission \n refraction) or be reflected. Following the mindset of this package, implementing a ray-splitting billiard requires only three very simple steps.\n\n\n\n\nRay-Splitting Obstacles\n\n\nFirst, an obstacle that supports ray-splitting is required to be present in your billiard table. The only new feature these obstacles have is an additional Boolean field called \nwhere\n. This field notes on which side of the obstacle the particle is currently propagating \n(if you are wondering how a distance can change sign, see the tutorial on Defining your own Obstacles)\n. The normal vector as well as the distance from boundary change sign depending on the value of \nwhere\n. The obstacles \nAntidot\n and \nSplitterWall\n are the equivalents of disk and wall for ray-splitting. To make your own defined obstacle support ray-splitting, visit this tutorial.\n\n\n\n\nThere is a simple reason for having extra Types to support ray-splitting: non ray-splitting Types  always perform 2 less operations in their innermost loops, saving a bit of time. Also, ray-splitting obstacles are defined as \ntype\n instead of as \nimmutable\n.\n\n\n\n\nLet's add an \nAntidot\n to a billiard table:\n\n\nusing\n \nDynamicalBilliards\n\n\nbt\n \n=\n \nbilliard_rectangle\n()\n\n\na\n \n=\n \nAntidot\n([\n0.5\n,\n0.5\n],\n \n0.3\n)\n\n\npush!\n(\nbt\n,\n \na\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay-Splitting Functions\n\n\nSecondly, for each obstacle in your billiard table that will perform ray-splitting, you have to define 3 functions. Notice that not every obstacle that supports ray-splitting actually has to perform it; it is up to the user. Those 3 functions are the following:\n\n\n\n\nT(\u03c6, \nwhere\n, \u03c9) : Takes as input the angle of incidence \u03c6 and returns the transmission probability \u03a4 depending on  whether the particle is inside or outside the obstacle (\nwhere\n) and optionally depending on \u03c9.  This function should be an even function with respect to \u03c6.\n\n\n\u03b8(\u03c6, \nwhere\n, \u03c9) : Takes as input the angle of incidence     \u03c6 and returns the the transmission (aka refraction)  angle \u03b8  depending on whether the particle is inside or outside the obstacle (\nwhere\n) and optionally depending on \u03c9.  This function should be an odd function with respect to \u03c6.\n\n\n\u03c9_new(\u03c9, \nwhere\n) : Angular velocity after transmission.\n\n\n\n\nThe above three functions use the \nsame convention\n: the argument \nwhere\n is the one the Obstacle has \nbefore transmission\n. For example, if a particle is outside a disk (let \nwhere = true\n here) and is transmitted inside the disk (\nwhere\n becomes \nfalse\n here), then all three functions will be given their second argument (the boolean one) as \ntrue\n!\n\n\n\n\nRay-Splitter Dictionary\n\n\nTo pass the information of the aforementioned functions into the main API (\nevolve!()\n) a dictionary is required, which we will call \"raysplitter\": \nraysplitter::Dict{Int, Vector{Function}}\n. The keys are integers and the values are vectors of functions.  This dictionary is a map of the obstacle index within the billiard table to the ray-splitting functions. For example, if we wanted to allocate ray-splitting functions for the 5th obstacle in our billiard table, which could be e.g. an \nAntidot\n, we would write something like:\n\n\nsa\n \n=\n \n(\n\u03b8\n,\n \nwhere\n,\n \n\u03c9\n)\n \n-\n \nwhere\n \n?\n \n2\n\u03b8\n \n:\n \n0.5\n\u03b8\n\n\nT\n \n=\n \n(\n\u03b8\n,\n \nwhere\n,\n \n\u03c9\n)\n \n-\n \nbegin\n\n  \nif\n \nwhere\n\n    \nabs\n(\n\u03b8\n)\n \n \n\u03c0\n/\n4\n \n?\n \n0.5\nexp\n(\n-\n(\n\u03b8\n)\n^\n2\n/\n2\n(\n\u03c0\n/\n8\n)\n^\n2\n)\n \n:\n \n0.0\n\n  \nelse\n\n    \n0.75\n*\nexp\n(\n-\n(\n\u03b8\n)\n^\n2\n/\n2\n(\n\u03c0\n/\n4\n)\n^\n2\n)\n\n  \nend\n\n\nend\n\n\nnewo\n \n=\n \n(\n\u03c9\n,\n \nbool\n)\n \n-\n \nbool\n \n?\n \n-\n0.5\n\u03c9\n \n:\n \n-\n2\n\u03c9\n\n\nraysplitter\n \n=\n \nDict\n(\n5\n \n=\n \n[\nT\n,\n \nsa\n,\n \nnewo\n])\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice the following two very important points: The functions \nmust accept the specific number of arguments shown in the previous section\n even if some are not used. Also, the functions must be given \nin the specific order: 1. transmission probability, 2. refraction angle, 3. new \u03c9\n in the vector passed to the dictionary.\n\n\nThe next step is very simple: the \nraysplitter\n dictionary is directly passed into \nevolve!()\n as a fourth argument.  Using the billiard table we defined previously, where its 5th element is a ray-splitting \nAntidot\n, we now do:\n\n\n\u03c9\n \n=\n \n4.0\n\n\np\n \n=\n \nrandominside\n(\nbt\n,\n \n\u03c9\n)\n\n\nxt\n,\n \nyt\n,\n \nvxt\n,\n \nvyt\n,\n \nts\n \n=\n \nconstruct\n(\nevolve!\n(\np\n,\n \nbt\n,\n \n100.0\n,\n \nraysplitter\n)\n...\n,\n \ndt\n \n=\n \n0.05\n)\n\n\nplot_billiard\n(\nbt\n)\n\n\nplot\n(\nxt\n,\n \nyt\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand everything works like a charm! A final difference to be noted is that in the case of ray-splitting with magnetic fields, the fourth value returned by \nevolve!()\n is not a number, but a vector of angular velocities \nomegas\n. The value \nomegas[i]\n is the angular velocity the particle has while propagating from state \npos[i], vel[i]\n to state \npos[i+1], vel[i+1]\n. The \nconstruct()\n function takes this into account.\n\n\n\n\nPhysics\n\n\nThe condition for transmission is simply: \nT(\u03c6, where, \u03c9) \n rand()\n. If it returns \ntrue\n, transmission (i.e. ray-splitting) will happen. Otherwise just specular reflection will take place.\n\n\nThe three key functions given to the \nraysplitter\n dictionary must have some properties in order to have physical meaning, like for example that the scattering probability function is even towards \u03c6. One of these properties is absolutely \nmandatory\n for this package to work properly. This is the property of total internal reflection, i.e. if the refraction angle is calculated to be greater/equal than \u03c0/2, no transmission can happen. \nThis condition is not assured internally\n and thefore you must be sure that your transmission probability function satisfies it. In the above example, the function \nT\n makes sure to return 0 in that case.\n\n\nIn order to test if the \nraysplitter\n dictionary you have defined has physical meaning, the function \nisphysical()\n is provided. Its documentation string has all the details one should know:\n\n\n\n\njulia\nisphysical(raysplitter::Dict{Int, Vector{Function}}; only_mandatory = false)\n\n\nReturn \ntrue\n if the given ray-splitting dictionary has properties of the physical world.\n\n\nSpecifically, check if (\u03c6 is the incidence angle):\n\n\n\n\nCritical angle means total reflection: If \u03b8(\u03c6) \u2265 \u03c0/2 then T(\u03c6) = 0\n\n\nTransmission probability is even function: T(\u03c6) \u2248 T(-\u03c6)\n\n\nRefraction angle is odd function: \u03b8(\u03c6) \u2248 -\u03b8(-\u03c6)\n\n\nRay reversal is true: \u03b8(\u03b8(\u03c6, where, \u03c9), !where, \u03c9) \u2248 \u03c6\n\n\nMagnetic conservation is true: (\u03c9_new(\u03c9_new(\u03c9, where), !where) \u2248 \u03c9\n\n\n\n\nThe first property is mandatory and must hold for correct propagation. They keyword \nonly_mandatory\n notes whether the rest of the properties should be tested or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVelocity measure\n\n\nThe \nMagneticParticle\n is assumed to always have a velocity vector of measure 1. This simplyfies the formulas used internally to a significant amount. During ray-splitting, the particle may be in areas with different fields, resulting in different angular velocities (result of the \"\u03c9_new\" function).\n\n\nPhysically, in such a situation, the velocity measure of the particle will also change. This is not implemented internally by \nDynamicalBilliards\n  during the evolution of the particle. However it is very easy to change this after the particle has evolved.",

That is why \nct[1]\n is always 0 since \nposs[1], vels[1]\n are the initial conditions. The angular velocity \n\u03c9[i]\n is the one the particle has while propagating from state \nposs[i], vels[i]\n to \ni+1\n.\n\n\nNotice that at any point, the velocity vector \nvels[i]\n is the one obtained \nafter\n the specular reflection of the (i-1)th collision.

The three functions given are drawn from the ray-splitting dictionary that is passed directly to  evolve!() . For a calculated incidence angle \u03c6, if T(\u03c6)   rand(), ray-splitting occurs. (See the section \"Ray-Splitting\" of the official documentation for more info.)  #  DynamicalBilliards.collisiontime     Function .  collisiontime ( p :: AbstractParticle ,   o :: Obstacle )   Calculate the collision time between given particle and obstacle.  The funtion chooses the appropriate method depending on the type of particle (magnetic or not) as well as the type of the obstacle. Returns the time that the particle, given its current position and Type, must be propagated to reach the collision point. This time can be given directly to  propagate!(p, time)  which brings the particle to the collision point.  In the case of magnetic propagation, there are always two possible collisions. The function internally decides which of the two will occur first, based on the sign of the angular velocity of the magnetic particle.  #  DynamicalBilliards.propagate!     Function .  propagate! ( p :: AbstractParticle ,   t )   Propagate the particle  p  for given time  t , changing appropriately the the  p.pos  and  p.vel  fields.  For a  Particle  the propagation is a straight line (i.e. velocity vector is constant).  For a  MagneticParticle  the propagation is circular motion with cyclic frequency  p.omega  and radius  1/p.omega .  #  DynamicalBilliards.evolve!     Function .  evolve!(p::AbstractParticle, bt::Vector{Obstacle}, ttotal)  Evolve the given particle  p  inside the billiard table  bt  for a total amount of time  ttotal . Return the states of the particle between collisions.  The evolution takes into account the particle's Type. E.g. if  typeof(p) == MagneticParticle  then magnetic evolution will take place.  Calling  Call the function like:  t ,   poss ,   vels ,   ( \u03c9 ) *   =   evolve! ( p ,   bt ,   ttotal )   (see \"Returns\" section for more)  To get the position, velocity and time timeseries from the above output, use the function  construct :  xt, yt, vxt, vyt, ts = construct(evolve!(p, bt, ttotal)...)  Returns  As noted by the \"!\" at the end of the function, it changes its argument  p  (particle). Most importantly however, this function also returns the main output expected by a billiard system. This output is a tuple of 3 (or 4) vectors:   ct::Vector{Float64}  : Collision times.  poss::Vector{SVector{2}}  : Positions during collisions.  vels:: Vector{SVector{2}})  : Velocities  exactly after  the collisions.  \u03c9 , either  Float64  or  Vector{Float64}  : Angular velocity(/ies).   In the case of straight propagation, only the first 3 are returned.  In the case of magnetic propagation, the 4th value is returned as well. This is either the angular velocity of the particle ( Float64 ), or in the case of ray-splitting it is a vector of the angular velocities at each time step ( Vector ).  The time  ct[i]  is the time necessary to reach state  poss[i+1], vels[i+1]  starting from the state  poss[i], vels[i] . That is why  ct[1]  is always 0 since  poss[1], vels[1]  are the initial conditions. The angular velocity  \u03c9[i]  is the one the particle has while propagating from state  poss[i], vels[i]  to  i+1 .  Notice that at any point, the velocity vector  vels[i]  is the one obtained  after  the specular reflection of the (i-1)th collision. The function  construct  takes that into account.  Ray-splitting billiards  No matter how complex ray-splitting processes you want, and irrespectively of how many obstacles in the billiard table can perform ray-splitting, there is only a single difference on the main function call: The  evolve!()  function is supplemented with a fourth argument,  ray_splitter::Dict{Int, Vector{Function}} . This dictionary object handles all ray-splitting processes in the billiard system. It is a map of the Obstacle index within the billiard table to the ray-splitting functions: (\u03c6 is the angle of incidence)   T(\u03c6, where, \u03c9) : Transmission probability.  \u03b8(\u03c6, where, \u03c9) : Transmission (aka refraction) angle.  \u03c9_new(\u03c9, where) : Angular velocity after transmission.   For more information and instructions on defining these functions please visit the official documentation.  #  DynamicalBilliards.construct     Function .  construct ( ct ,   poss ,   vels [,   \u03c9 ][,   dt = 0.01 ])   Given the main output of this package (see  evolve!()  function) construct the timeseries of the position and velocity, as well as the time vector.  In case of not given \u03c9 (or \u03c9 == 0), straight construction takes place. In case of \u03c9 != 0 or in case of \u03c9::Vector{Real} magnetic construction takes place.  The additional optional argument of  dt  (only valid for Magnetic construction) is the timestep with which the timeseries are constructed.  Calling  Call this function like:  # Straight propagation:  xt ,   yt ,   vxt ,   vyt ,   ts   =   construct ( ct ,   poss ,   vels )  # Magnetic propagation:  xt ,   yt ,   vxt ,   vyt ,   ts   =   construct ( ct ,   poss ,   vels ,   \u03c9 ,   dt )  # Any-kind-of propagation (skip dt for straight):  xt ,   yt ,   vxt ,   vyt ,   ts   =   construct ( evolve! ( p ,   bt ,   ttotal [,   ray_splitter ]) ... ,   dt )   There is no difference in the  construct  call for Ray-Splitting billiards if one uses the awesome ellipsis operator of Julia. The reason for that is that  evolve!()  also returns the vector of angular velocities when necessary.  Returns  A tuple of the following:   xt::Vector{Float64} : x position time-series  yt::Vector{Float64} : y position time-series  vxt::Vector{Float64} : x velocity time-series  vyt::Vector{Float64} : y velocity time-series  ts::Vector{Float64} : Continuous time vector   #  DynamicalBilliards.isphysical     Function .  isphysical ( raysplitter : :Dict { Int ,   Vector { Function } } ;   only_mandatory   =   false )   Return  true  if the given ray-splitting dictionary represends the physical world.  Specifically, check if (\u03c6 is the incidence angle):   Critical angle means total reflection: If \u03b8(\u03c6) \u2265 \u03c0/2 then T(\u03c6) = 0  Transmission probability is even function: T(\u03c6) \u2248 T(-\u03c6)  Refraction angle is odd function: \u03b8(\u03c6) \u2248 -\u03b8(-\u03c6)  Ray reversal is true: \u03b8(\u03b8(\u03c6, where, \u03c9), !where, \u03c9) \u2248 \u03c6  Magnetic conservation is true: (\u03c9_new(\u03c9_new(\u03c9, where), !where) \u2248 \u03c9   The first property is mandatory and must hold for correct propagation. They keyword  only_mandatory  notes whether the rest of the properties should be tested or not.",
