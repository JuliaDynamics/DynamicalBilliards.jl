# Ray-Splitting
Ray-splitting is a semi-classical approach to the billiard system, giving a wave attribute to the ray traced by the particle.
Upon collision a particle may propagate through an obstacle (transmission & refraction) or be reflected. Following the mindset of this package, implementing a ray-splitting billiard requires only three simple steps. We will introduce them and demonstrate
them using a simple example in this documentation page.

## 1. Ray-Splitting Obstacles
The first step is that an [`Obstacle`](@ref) that supports ray-splitting is required to be present in your billiard table. The only new feature these obstacles have is an additional Boolean field called `pflag` (propagation flag). This field notes on which side of the obstacle the particle is currently propagating.

The normal vector as well as the distance from boundary change sign depending on the value of `pflag`. The obstacles [`Antidot`](@ref), [`SplitterWall`](@ref) and [`FiniteSplitterWall`](@ref) are the equivalents of disk, wall and finite-wall for ray-splitting.

Let's create a billiard with a bunch of ray-splitting obstacles!
```@example ray
using DynamicalBilliards
x, y = 2.0, 1.0
bdr =  billiard_rectangle(x, y)
sw = SplitterWall([x/2, 0.0], [x/2,y], [-1,0], true)
a1 = Antidot([x/4, y/2], 0.25, "Left Antidot")
a2 = Antidot([3x/4, y/2], 0.15, "Right Antidot")
bd = Billiard(a1, a2, sw, bdr...)
```

```@example ray
using PyPlot
plot(bd)
savefig("raybil.svg"); nothing # hide
```
![](raybil.svg)

## 2. The `RaySplitter` structure
In the second step, you have to define 2+1 functions: transmission probability,
refraction angle and optionally new angular velocity after transmission. These functions, as well as which obstacles participate in ray-splitting, are bundled into a special structure:
```@docs
RaySplitter
```

If you want different type of transmission/refraction functions for
different obstacles, then you define multiple `RaySplitter`s.

Continuing from the above billiard, let's also create some `RaySplitter` instances
for it.

First define a refraction function
```@example ray
refraction(φ, pflag, ω) = pflag ? 0.5φ : 2.0φ
```
Then, a transmission probability function. In this example, we want to create a
function that given some factor `p`, it returns a probability weighted with
`p` in one direction of ray-splitting and `1-p` in another direction.
```@example ray
transmission_p(p) = (φ, pflag, ω) -> begin
    if pflag
        p*exp(-(φ)^2/2(π/8)^2)
    else
        abs(φ) < π/4 ? (1-p)*exp(-(φ)^2/2(π/4)^2) : 0.0
    end
end
```
Notice also how we defined the function in such a way that critical refraction is
respected, i.e. if `θ(φ) ≥ π/2` then `T(φ) = 0`. Although this is necessary from a
physical perspective, the code does take care of it by clamping the
refraction angle (see below).

Lastly, for this example we will use magnetic propagation. We define functions
such that the antidots also reverse the direction and magnitude of the magnetic field.
```@example ray
newoantidot(x, bool) =  bool ? -2.0x : -0.5x
newowall(x, bool) = bool ? 0.5x : 2.0x
```

Now we create the [`RaySplitter`](@ref) instances we want
```@example ray
raywall = RaySplitter([3], transmission_p(0.5), refraction, newowall)
raya = RaySplitter([1, 2], transmission_p(0.8), refraction, newoantidot)
```
Because we want to use same functions for both antidots, we gave
both indices in `raya`, `[1, 2]` (which are the indices of the antidots in the
billiard `bd`).

## 3. Evolution with Ray-Splitting
The third step is trivial. After you have created your `RaySplitter`(s),
you simply pass them into `evolve` or `animate_evolution` as a fourth argument!
If you have many instances of `RaySplitter` you pass a tuple of them.

For example,
```@example ray
using Random
Random.seed!(42)
p = randominside(bd, 1.0)
raysplitters = (raywall, raya)
xt, yt, vxt, vyt, tt = timeseries(p, bd, 100, raysplitters)
plot(bd)
plot(xt, yt)
scatter(xt[1], yt[1], color = "black")
savefig("rayorbit.svg"); nothing # hide
```
![](rayorbit.svg)

You can see that at some points the particle crossed the boundaries of the
red obstacles, which allow for ray splitting. It is even cooler to animate
this motion using [`animate_evolution`](@ref)!

```

!!! info "Resetting the billiard"
    Notice that evolving a particle inside a billiard always mutates the billiard
    if ray-splitting is used. This means that you should always set the fields
    `pflag` of some obstacles to the values you desire after *each* call
    to `evolve`. If you use the function [`randominside`](@ref) you must definitely
    do this!

    The function `reset_billiard!(bd)` turns all `pflag`s to `true`.


!!! warning "Angle of refraction is clamped"
    Internally we clamp the output of the angle of refraction function. Let `c = DynamicalBilliards.CLAMPING_ANGLE` (currently `c = 0.1`). We clamp `θ` to
    `-π/2 + c ≤ θ ≤ π/2 - c`. This is so that the relocating algorithm does not fall into an infinite loop.
    You can change the value of `c` but very small values can lead to infinite loops in extreme cases.

## The Ray-Splitting Algorithm
In this section we describe the algorithm we follow to implement the ray-splitting
process. Let $T$ denote the transmission function, $\theta$ the refraction function and $\omega_{\text{new}}$ the new angular velocity function. The following describes the process after a particle has reached an obstacle that supports ray-splitting.

1.  Find the angle of incidence $\phi' = \pi - \arccos(\vec{v} \cdot \vec{n}) = \arccos(\vec{v} \cdot (-\vec{n}))$ with $\vec{n}$ the normal vector at collision point. Notice that we use here $-\vec{n}$ because the velocity is opposing the normal vector before the collision happens. Using $-\vec{n}$ gives the angle between 0 and $\pi/2$ instead of $\pi/2$ to $\pi$.

2.  Find the *correct* sign of the incidence angle, $\phi = \pm \phi'$. Specifically, use the cross product: if the third entry of $\vec{v} \times \vec{n}$ is negative, then have minus sign. The "correct" sign debates on whether the velocity vector is to the right or to the left of $(-\vec{n})$. This is important for finding the correct transmission angle and/or probability.

3.  Check if $T(\phi, \verb|pflag|, \omega) > \text{random}()$. If not, do standard specular reflection.

4. If ray-splitting happens, then relocate the particle so that it is on the *other* side of the colliding obstacle. This contrasts the main evolution algorithm of this billiard package.

5. Re-compute the *correct* angle of incidence, as the position of the particle generally changes with relocating.

6.  Find refraction angle $\theta(\phi, \verb|pflag|, \omega)$. Notice that this is a relative angle with respect to the normal vector. Also notice that $\theta$ may have opposite sign from $\phi$. It depends on the user if they want to add anomalous refraction.

7.  Set `obstacle.pflag = !obstacle.pflag` for *all* obstacles affected by the current `RaySplitter`. This reverses $\vec{n}$ to $-\vec{n}$ as well! So from now on $\vec{n}$ is the opposite than what it was at the beginning of the algorithm!

8.  Find the refraction angle in absolute space. First find $a = \text{atan}(n_y, n_x)$ and then set $\Theta = a + \theta$.

9. Perform refraction, i.e. set the particle velocity to the direction of $\Theta$.

10. Scale the magnetic field, i.e. set `p.omega` = $\omega_{\text{new}}(\omega, \verb|!pflag|)$. It is important to note that we use `!pflag` because we have already changed the `pflag` field.


## Physics of the Ray-Splitting Functions
If `T` is the transmission probability function, then the condition for transmission is simply: `T(φ, pflag, ω) > rand()`. If it returns `true`, transmission (i.e. ray-splitting) will happen.

The functions given to [`RaySplitter`](@ref) should have some properties in order to have physical meaning.
In order to test if the `RaySplitter` you have defined has physical meaning, the function `isphysical` is provided
```@docs
isphysical
```

## Snell's Law

In classical geometric optics, the refraction of a ray of light moving from one
medium to another is described by Snell's law. For an angle of incidence of
$\phi$, the refraction angle $\theta$ is determined by the equation

```math
\frac{sin(\phi)}{\sin(\theta)} = \frac{n'}{n}
```

where $n$ and $n'$ are the respective refractive indices of the media.

To easily simulate these relations in `DynamicalBilliards`, the function
`law_of_refraction` can be used to set up ray-splitting according to this law.

```@docs
law_of_refraction
```

Using the functions returned by `law_of_refraction`, we can set up a
`RaySplitter` for a billiard.
```@example lens
using DynamicalBilliards, PyPlot
# Create a circular "lens"
o = Antidot(SVector(1.0, 0.75), 0.5)
# in a rectangular box
bd = Billiard(billiard_rectangle(2.5, 1.5)..., o)
# create a RaySplitter using law of refraction
trans, refra = law_of_refraction(1.5)
rs = (RaySplitter([5], trans, refra),)
```
We now animate the evolution of an array of particles on parallel trajectories to
demonstrate the refractive properties of the spherical lens
```julia
# create parallel particles
ps = [Particle(0.1, y, 0.0) for y in 0.4:0.05:1.1]

# animate
animate_evolution(ps, bd, 2.0, rs, colors = ["C0" for i ∈ 1:length(ps)],
  tailtime=2.5, savename = "lens")
```

## Example of Affecting Multiple Obstacles
Here we will show an application of *inverse* billiards, where particles go in and out
of a billiard, while taking advantage of the existence of a magnetic field outside to return.

As always, we define the ray-splitting functions:
```@example ray
using DynamicalBilliards, PyPlot
trans(args...) = 1.0 # always perfect transmission
refra(φ, pflag, ω) = pflag ? 0.8φ : 1.25φ # refraction angle
neww(ω, pflag) = pflag ? 2.0 : 0.4
```
Now, when we define the [`RaySplitter`](@ref) instance we will choose a different
value for `affect`:
```@example ray
ray = RaySplitter([1,2,3,4], trans, refra, neww, affect = (i) -> SVector(1,2,3,4))
```

We initialize a simple rectangular billiard and a particle
```@example ray
bd = billiard_rectangle(setting = "ray-splitting")
p = MagneticParticle(0.4, 0.6, 0.0, 0.4)
```

and we animate its evolution, by first zooming out of the billiard
```julia
plot(bd)
xlim(-1, 2); ylim(-1, 2);
animate_evolution(p, bd, 10.0, (ray,); ax = gca(), savename = "inverse", tailtime = 3.0)
```
