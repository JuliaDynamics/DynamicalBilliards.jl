![DynamicalBilliards v3.0 Logo: The Julia billiard](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/JuliaDynamics/blob/master/videos/billiards/DynamicalBilliards_logo_animated.gif?raw=true)

`DynamicalBilliards` is an easy-to-use, modular and extendable Julia package for
dynamical billiards in two dimensions.
It is part of [JuliaDynamics](https://juliadynamics.github.io/JuliaDynamics/), an organization dedicated to creating high quality scientific software.

## About Billiards

A dynamical billiard is a system where a particle is propagating inside a domain,
bouncing from obstacle to obstacle (i.e. the *boundary* of the domain) by a specular reflection at the boundary of the obstacles. This basic idea can be extended in many ways, one of which is replacing the particle orbit from a straight line to a circle.

Billiard systems have been used extensively in mathematics, nonlinear dynamics and chaos and played an important role in the development of nonlinear science.
The [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_billiards) has many examples of different types of billiards. Also, the [scholarpedia](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Dynamical_billiards) entry is a good read on the subject.

## Features

* Particles are evolved by solving *exactly* the geometric equations for intersections between lines, circles, ellipses, and other shapes. There are no approximations done regarding the dynamics.
* Modular creation of a [Billiard](@ref) from well defined obstacles. Arbitrary billiard shapes can be made and no shape is "hard coded".
* Full support for both *straight*  and *magnetic* propagation of a particle in a billiard table.
  * During magnetic propagation the particle orbit is a circle instead of a line!
  * All features exist for both types of propagation!
  * See the [High Level API](@ref) to get started!

* Support for creating [Random initial conditions](@ref) in an arbitrary billiard.
* [Ray-Splitting](@ref): a particle may propagate
  through an obstacle given arbitrary transmission and refraction
  laws. This is also known as a "semiclassical billiard".
* [PoincarÃ© Sections](@ref) (intersections with arbitrary plane).
* [Boundary Maps](@ref).
* [Escape Times](@ref) & [Mean Collision Times](@ref).
* [Lyapunov Exponents](@ref).
* Support for both coordinate systems: 3D real space and boundary coordinates.
* Novel algorithms that compute the portion of either the 2D boundary space or the 3D real space that an orbit covers as a particle evolves. See the [Phase Spaces](@ref) section.
* Easy to use low-level interface, described at the [Internals](@ref) page.
* Specialized tools for mushroom billiards.
* Full support for [Visualizations and Animations for Billiards](@ref).
* Brutal tests that confirm the package works and overcomes numerical precision issues.

This package does not support finite-sized particles and, as a result, there is also no support for collision between particles.

## How to easily code a Billiard

We have created a [Jupyter notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JuliaDynamics/JuliaDynamics/blob/master/tutorials/Billiards%20Example/billiards_example.ipynb) that showcases how easy it is to simulate a dynamical billiard using Julia. This [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JuliaDynamics/JuliaDynamics/blob/master/tutorials/Billiards%20Example/billiards_example.ipynb) is an educative example of both using Multiple Dispatch and of how the internal code of `DynamicalBilliards` works. It also highlights the extendibility of the core code.

Besides a Jupyter notebook, this tutorial is also available as an interactive article in the new platform NextJournal [here](https://nextjournal.com/julia/billiard).
